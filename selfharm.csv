2,"Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.",suicide

9,"I‚Äôm so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and I‚Äôve been struggling for years and I‚Äôm afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I‚Äôm so close to my limit . I‚Äôve been quiet for so long and I‚Äôm too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I‚Äôve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I‚Äôve experienced in life? Only time I‚Äôve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I‚Äôm still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as I‚Äôve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I‚Äôve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as ‚Äúhappiest she‚Äôs ever seen me, therapy has helped him‚Äù 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I‚Äôm sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I‚Äôve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I‚Äôve caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, I‚Äôm as afraid as I‚Äôve ever been . I‚Äôve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What‚Äôs my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.

11,"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). 

I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 

I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not. Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak, while they could cure cancer or something useful.

 I did work on my car last night and I hadn't self harmed in a LONG time. I just did it without thinking, as usual; impulse and lost in the moment.


Should I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist. They are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep. 

I think the car excuse  is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns. Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine?

32,"Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this, though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteria.

I am trapped inside a void.  There is absolutely nothing for me.  I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever.  The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren.  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and she‚Äôs assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.

She made me feel accepted.  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth.  She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was.  But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I‚Äôve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.

We have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am.  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I don‚Äôt blame her.  I do nothing but hurt her these days.  None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasn‚Äôt.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.  

For about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn‚Äôt have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn‚Äôt have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn‚Äôt have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.

I miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn‚Äôt leave my room for two weeks.  I didn‚Äôt eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.

It was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn‚Äôt happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don‚Äôt remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn‚Äôt believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn‚Äôt talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a ‚Äúred string of fate.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt believe in fate, but I also don‚Äôt think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I don‚Äôt have anything at all to give in a friendship.

After fighting with Maren, and being told that I can‚Äôt keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.

I am getting tired of writing, though.  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them.  I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them.  I am writing this because I now have zero friends.  I am completely alone.  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.

(I amar prestar aen.)

The world is changed.

I feel it in the water.

(Han mathon ned cae.)

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One ring to rule them all.

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father‚Äôs sword.

Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.

It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollum‚Äôs cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

107,"Anyone planning suicide in the long-term future?I'm a depressed 22F who is considering suicide, but not soon, but within maybe 4-5 years.
Why do I want to kill myself?
It's kind of a long story. But the main reasons are a combination: (Lack of) Economic Stability, Health Problems, Family
along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life.

**Economic**:

Growing up was hard and I've had to overcome a lot of adversity (lower-income household, mother dying at
a young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc), like a lot of people here.
I'm in college currently, but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major, college 
just seems very oppressive. I know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial.
My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school
or even CC for a few years (I had relatively good grades in high school). I knew from the moment I was on campus
that I hated it; lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, I didn't have a good sense of direction
or idea for a major/career and never felt inspired. I thought about transferring, but didn't have the 
resources or finances (first-generation college student), so I stuck it out though I was depressed. I did well academically
but since my major/department is kinda shitty (applied math), I'm worried that I won't get a good paying job, unlike
engineering students. Like had I known earlier, I would have just majored in that instead. I will leave college
next year with about 25-28K in loans.

**Family**:

Generally, I strongly dislike my family life. My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house
as fast as they could. My mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming
self-sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife (unemployed) and kids, even though he's pretty old
and should be focusing on retirement. I haven't come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it.
(not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family-oriented). My parents are also immigrants so we don't have
tons of wealthy family here.

**Health**:
I have a lot of chronic, probably genetically-caused, health diseases since I was young.
When I was young and in my mid-teens, I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive.
After my mom died, my dad didn't bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists
anymore, my health has decreased. It's hard at college too, because I don't have a car, and I didn't always have
health insurance to be able to see anyone. So my health continues to decrease. These aren't
life-threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self-conscious.

So because of all this, I find it hard to justify continuing life. I am kind of a nihilist and definitely 
an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife. I don't want to kill myself yet, but in 3-4 years,
when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide-planning once I'm in the ""real world"".
I've seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even.
It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first-generation college student background with severly
limited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years. And it's
hard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper-middle class families succeed in life, when it's a
constant struggle for me.And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what's the point? Why suffer and
struggle so much in life if I don't really see a reason too? Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed
with me and is truly planning suicide in the future.I'm also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or
expanding on the reasons above, though I doubt people can change my mind.

TL:DR: Want to wait 3-4 years before committing suicide. Basically I personally see life worth living if
I'm economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy. However, for a multitude of complex
reasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me. I am also a nihilist, atheist and 
don't see a point to life, other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living.",suicide

110,"Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide (and other parts of dealing with depression)I've been a little low lately, so this matters to me. I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.

I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. 

But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people  see that too. Especially people who know what its like.

I know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.

Another complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?

Someone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.

My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).

I know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it.",suicide

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I‚Äôm gay. This wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if I didn‚Äôt have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed as anything really, but I don‚Äôt really care because it doesn‚Äôt take a fucking expert‚Äôs opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I‚Äôve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I‚Äôve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I‚Äôve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there‚Äôs definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I‚Äôve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I‚Äôm glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I‚Äôm going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn‚Äôt do this, and even if I were to walk out, I‚Äôd probably wouldn‚Äôt because I felt like if I did, I‚Äôd just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they‚Äôre an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I‚Äôll be honest, it‚Äôs hard sometimes but I feel no sense of ‚Äúselfness‚Äù I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn‚Äôt even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn‚Äôt exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I‚Äôm feeling like absolute shit and I‚Äôve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I‚Äôm lazy and that even I couldn‚Äôt amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it‚Äôs never going to happen, I don‚Äôt even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can‚Äôt just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can‚Äôt help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that I‚Äôm going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I‚Äôve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5

Today has particularly been a rocky day though, and I feel like that grip on staying here for her is weakening.

I started having ugly thoughts tonight, like how I was so jealous of Kobe and the other victims of that helicopter crash. Or how I wish I were infected with the coronavirus and on my way out. I‚Äôm actually embarrassed to admit this, but at the same time feel so passionately about these desires, it scares me.

For the first time in I think maybe 3 or 4 years I started researching suicide methods. My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve, and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully. I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently. The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe, but I don‚Äôt know what I even need to say to him besides sorry. Still, this terrifies me but excites me, I just crave life to be over so often and I‚Äôm getting restless.

No matter what happens in life, I always end up in the same place. I keep fighting but I‚Äôm wondering who‚Äôs battle is this actually? I‚Äôm definitely not fighting for myself anymore. I‚Äôve officially given up and am just waiting for my dad to come home from a trip so I can see him one last time.",suicide

The past few months have been especially hard for some reason.  I have very little money left, no immediate family, one friend I see once a week, and a fiancee who I love but who is also under a great deal of mental and emotional stress (and being around me doesn't make it any better).  I have talked to both master's and PhD level therapists this year and it never helps.  Talk therapy doesn't fix anything for me.  Maybe it's because my bachelor's degree is in psychology but it never helps anything.

The days where I don't think about (bad things) are probably fewer than the ones where I do, and that makes me so sad.

Sometimes I feel like I can't do it anymore, and it disappoints me because I've got a lot going for me on paper (got accepted back to college for a second bachelor's degree recently), but most days it's a struggle just to wake up and go to my job.  I feel like I just want to go away and let the world go on without me, and I realize that's a dangerous kind of thinking that I need to nip in the bud before it gets the better of me.

I was drinking a lot this past year but I've been trying to quit for a few weeks too.  Not being able to numb myself to the same degree has led to many nights where I don't sleep well, where I get lost in my own thoughts, and where I go to bad places quickly.

I have many hobbies and I have passions, but I have no passion for those passions on my bad days.

I need to do something to fix myself.  I don't want to have this constant cloud over me anymore.  Any ideas as to what I should do?

I feel like the levels between my coping mechanisms and my overwhelming pervasive depression are very skewed in the direction of the latter.

Thanks for listening anyway, helped to type that out.

**Edit:**  To clarify, I am talking about real, actual mental health help - or perhaps medication - not reading self help books, not going for a run, not meditating.  I have done all of those things ad nauseum.  I do them regularly.  I try to fill my life with as much of the ""positive lifestyle"" kind of stuff as I possibly can, but it's not working.  I've read everything from the entire Taoist canon to Marcus Aurelius to Steven Hawking to Kierkegaard to Tai Chi masters and beyond.  Respectfully, please understand that telling me to just jog it off isn't going to help.  I work out daily.  I am meticulous about trying to eat healthy.  I don't drink like a fish anymore.  I need real help and I don't know what to do.",suicide
131,"I think I need to check myself into a hospital. I need your guys' advice.4 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. It wasn't really news, I've known I've been depressed for years (approaching 3 1/2 years now). I got prescribed Zoloft, and I'm up to 75mg now. I've also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now. Its not working though. If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it's not even getting worse at a slower rate.

Over the last few years I've made a lot of changes to try to help. I went from 198 to 150, I started eating healthier, I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, I transferred colleges since the first one wasn't working out, I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, I even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything. Now I've finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric.

And none of it has helped. If anything, its only gotten worse since I don't even have the hope that any more changes will help. The hope is gone. When I was a kid, I used to get Pneumonia a lot. I had it like 5 times before I was 3. I wish I'd have just died back then, I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me.

The latest ""I think I would be happy if..."" thing has been getting in a relationship. I think I'm thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes I haven't yet made, and because I pretty genuinely hate myself (I've pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA, I don't really believe in inherent self-worth). I'm almost 21 now and haven't ever been on a date, let alone received a non-platonic hug. Nobody ever expresses interest in me, I always have to initiate (thought I've found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if I don't initiate I'd never get invited to anything). I can't even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit. It's not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to. It feels like all the changes I've made over the years have amounted to nothing.

I'm just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time. I haven't been able to cry in years, so I just self harm when I feel like crying. It's not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn't give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense. Besides, it beats drinking heavily like most 'normal' people my age do (though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk).

All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers. It feels like I've gotten left behind on the road of life. Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I've started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I'm trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that's all I ever get ""I'm sure you'll find someone eventually."" Thing is, none of the ""I'd might be happy if..."" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores, EU4 is too frustrating now. I've already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through. I don't enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year. I don't have any shows I really enjoy. I've always wanted to learn to draw, I'm actually a huge fan of furry art, but I'm pretty bad and I'm a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can't do it and get better.

Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with ""get better"" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I'd be better off. I used to think ""Ok, I'll wait until I turn 30, and then I'll kill myself if things haven't improved."" However, as things have deteriorated, I've moved that up to 25. More recently, I've moved it up to after graduation (I'm thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don't even know how I'm going to make it that far. Suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something I have to do.

I don't buy the whole ""it gets better"" thing anymore. Its been over 3 years. It really doesn't in my experience. All the medical advice I've been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself. I don't understand to what end though? Like, if I don't kill myself now, then what? I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is ""why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?"" I don't see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I'll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I'm gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don't have to hurt anymore, people who love me don't have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I've been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up. Of course, this is still likely a few years away, so I'm probably not at immediate risk of killing myself.

So thats where I'm standing. It's 3AM right now and I can't sleep anymore because I went to bed at 7 last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again. The Zoloft just gives me headaches, makes me hungry, and gives me constipation. Nothing has helped, and I don't think I can get better anymore.

I have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon. I don't know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point. What should I do?

That‚Äôs the oldest I‚Äôve ever been. It‚Äôs the oldest I‚Äôm ever meant to be.


I don‚Äôt remember when I had the first dream. It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and real‚Ä¶ Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and you‚Äôre lying in bed wondering.


‚ÄúDid I just wake up‚Ä¶ or just fall asleep.‚Äù


The fragments don‚Äôt seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.


In these dreams, I‚Äôve seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.


It took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and I‚Äôm forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasn‚Äôt until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. I‚Äôve cousins who experience the same. We‚Äôve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn‚Äôt understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.


29


Out of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.


I‚Äôve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasn‚Äôt going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I can‚Äôt say for certain why I chose 27‚Ä¶ Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except I‚Äôm far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, I‚Äôve always just been drawn to it.


When my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan I‚Äôd concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.


29


It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where I‚Äôm a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who‚Äôs aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.


We fixate on negatives, humans that is. It‚Äôs an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. I‚Äôm far from being a master at this myself.


‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?‚Äù


Is it because that‚Äôs when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?


Or is it something more positive‚Ä¶ Does the family‚Äôs clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?


Maybe we aren‚Äôt clairvoyant. Odds are it‚Äôs just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. I‚Äôve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.


Is it going to end at 29‚Ä¶ am I going to see the other side of 30? If I don‚Äôt, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe I‚Äôm not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.


I don‚Äôt make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I can‚Äôt say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.


‚ÄúHow would she react?‚Äù


‚ÄúWhat would the funeral look like?‚Äù


How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for ages‚Ä¶ Likely never settling back down into their original position.


That‚Äôs the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.


It has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know I‚Äôve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So I‚Äôve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.


Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others‚Äô feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, I‚Äôm not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.


With some luck, maybe‚Ä¶ Just maybe 29 isn‚Äôt the end‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just a new beginning.

176,"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick. During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.

In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.

After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.

Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?

At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn‚Äôt and actually it‚Äôs just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn‚Äôt feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would‚Äôve if I‚Äôd done anything wrong.

Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.

But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

I haven't been able to go on and cry, get emotional, get real. I'm so fucking done with this. I don't trust anyone enough to talk to them. I have people I know I can trust, but for some reason I don't trust them. Maybe it's because I know that at any moment they can betray me. Reveal all of my problems to someone I don't even know.

Point is, crying is important. If you ever start crying, cry your fucking heart out. Trust me, you'll need it.",non-suicide

Then there are my grades I had a c in math and progress reports where going out you only get one if you have a d grade or lower but my teacher gave one to me. And ingot in trouble because my parents expect at least a b. Then last week we had a test. I was getting my grades up I was almost to a b but then I notice I see a day later my grade went down by almost 30 points. And  I thought I did well I knew for a fact I passed that test. I double checked my answers triple checked I had to have at least got most right. But then I see I have an f now. The test wasn't even 30 points. Now I'm screwed the quarters almost over and the home work which is most of our grade is only Worth one point IF my teacher grades it sometimes he ""forgets"" so it's pretty much impossible to get your grade up. And his response to asking about my grade is do your work. Pretending I don't turn in all of my work on time. I'm so stressed out 8th grade sucks I hate it.

180,"no rewards for resistensehi reddit. i am an anon. i do not know why i am postting this reaaly. perhaps a chance to hear myself speak? perhaps an open forum to categorise my thoughtS? perhaps just because... and because is enough.

ten years ago i gave up on life. i crossed a lne.

it's not despair or depression that keep me beyond that line. it is fatigue.

a member of my family was suisidal. to my knowledge they still are. we don not speak about it. we are unable to now.

i supported them for years. dropped out of school to work and finnancially keep them afloat. i cooked. cleaned. i managed our lives. while they drunk. got depressed.

they had been committed to a mental institution once for a failed attempt. i still remember the smell of that building. the glazed eyes of the patients who were being medicated there. the woman who began a conversation with me saying that she did not kill her husband and the haunting knowledge that i first heard the phrase ""never say goodbye, that is forever. only say see you later"" from her lips.

three years i supported that person. because i love them. we were all the other had in the world. i was too weak to stop them drinking. how could i take away their vice? what else would they do while i worked?

their depression grew stronger. i soldiered on.

eventually it got too much. another failed attempt. they had already taken the pills before i got home.

i always blamed myself for not dealing with them when drunk. i supported in all ways but never well enough.

we argued. i was tired. empty. had nothing left to give.

i yelled at them. i told them how i would benefit from them giving in and just doing it. they did not back down. they called my bluff. they told me to do it with them.

that pure and perfect opportunity to just exit. in that moment i was ready. i was ready because i had given everything and the atlas struggle would finally be over if i just did not fight or resist anymore. if i just let reality wash over me and consume me. ---to this day that feeling of surrender is one of the best emotions i can remember. i was ready.

they backed down when i agreed. they saw what their attitude had done and in a moment of selflessness my family member backed down.

we sat up that night. the pills were still in their system.

they did not die.

years pass.

i move on.

they move on.

that night lives on as a memory only in my head. there are times i wonder if it happened at all. how would i know if it had or had not.

time kept pushing on me. struggle after struggle came and i conquered them.

while caring for my family member i had developed an ability to weather these storms. push through. get through. keep your head down. survive. endure.

god it's such a struggle.

that memory of surrender haunts me.

but i have family now. i have friends. i have people who need me.

so i weather.

i endure.

i found the best way to cope with life is to disassociate with it. not take it on board.

i no longer know how to handle compliments.

my years of training under a suicidal dependant have made me terrified of failure. if i do not live to every expectation i will make things worse. i will cause an episode. i need to do everything. for everyone.

i make life a struggle. i keep heaping on these challenges. taking on more responsibility. breaking myself.

and i never feel satisfaction.

that's the worst part. i don't even feel relief anymore. once i've accomplished something. i just press on.

that has become my life. add on more. feel more pressure. never release. never pride. only failure.

i'm so tired.

and i don't know how to ask for help. i cannot expect anyone to understand. i try so hard to explain it but the words do not come out right.

""you should feel pride""

""take some credit""

and if i speak up they take the rug away... ""you should not do so much"" ""you know what happens when you push yourself""

i feel worthless when that happens.

so i just disassociate. stop thinking of myself. stop applying my self to anything. that way i no one will bother me. no one will make me feel worse by trying to rescue me.

i do not feel sad. i do not really feel happy. i just go with the flow. think about how others feel all the time. live to make them happy. at least then my presence will be worthwhile.

i fake it.

i fake it because i can not remember how to be honest.

when people try to get in i kneejerk push them away. i keep trying to push past that. all i can do is offer content without emotion. i cannot apply myself to any story. to any pleas. i just sit here rotting in the back of my brain.

where no one will be dragged in to my void.

where no one will watch me dead on the inside.

where no one will offer pity.

no shame.

no being locked in like i once was.",suicide

182,"I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitableI've graduated from one of the best universities in my country which I'd got accepted with a scholarship and national degree in university entrence exams. I've graduated with 3.2/4 gpa score. I've gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme, I've played in a great band for the first 3 years of my university life, had been selpt with 5-6 women which I had a serious relationship that last 2.5 years with 2 of them. I've graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies. My first ever game had got downloaded by 2 million people during my first job experience. This year at 14th Februrary, everything was changed. My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy, my parents got divorced (and they were very verbal to me about this topic), I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries (totally different industry that I'd imagine for my career). I dont know, I think I've accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better. 

I could do better if I was living in a different country, I could do better if I didn't waste my time on two long serious relationships. I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent's offer to pay for it (I didn't want to make them pay for MY education). I could do better if I didn't have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme. I could do better if I didn't stop making music or writing poems and stories, I could do better if I didn't take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey. Everything I did seems like a failure to me. And worst of all, I've gained a lot of weight, my self esteem is on the ground, I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything.

Anyways, for people around me, I am a succesfull, mature, intellectual, functioning person with interesting hobbies. But inside of my mind, these things just doesn't matter. I was so pumped by my parents, my friends and my girlfriends, nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills (social, artistic, general etc.). 

I dont add value to anyone around me. Noone needs me, Noone craves for my love, needs my support, needs me around them. 

I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers. But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them. I can not seem to get laid nowadays, if you exclude some of my ex gf's. that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life (and boy, it was great). I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to. I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions. I used to have strong believes about life, politics, relationships (I'm an atheist), and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind. 

Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities, and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible; muslim-heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire, wannabe ""highly cultural"" social media slaves/plaza workers, bigheaded academics who doesn't give a shit about their thesis student, women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men, people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have. 

Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in, I am so sorry people. I wish English was my mother tongue, but it isn't and I am not confident the way I express myself. 

This life, is too complicating, too demanding, too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey. I want to leave here, but I don't know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country. Here, I am an intellectual, succesfull computer engineer; outside of Turkey, I am a fucking roach. I've sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country. Noone wants me. How do I escape here? Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life? Would it worth the effort? I don't know.

Death, seems like such a sweet release to me. I just want to die, naturally, at this moment, in an instant. I had enough. I had my peak  at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it. I've been depressed before, even got some medical treatment for it. It doesn't feel like being depressed at all. It is just... there is no meaning in anything at all. We are bunch of atoms. Dying will just stop all of it. I wouldn't care for anyone and anything If I was dead. I wouldn't be upset about the fact that I could do much, have children and stuff. Dead doesn't care. Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable. ",suicide

He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like ""I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend"" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend"". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say ""you deserve a nice boyfriend"" and things like that.

most of the time we commit violent acts because we're angry or frustrated, by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world, say for example DOOM(you know the drill we all like BFG division). you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people, but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things, I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood, the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth (I just didn't feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing), that's why I think cyberbullying isn't a problem, if you know how to treat is properly(my own opinion, you guys might know something I don't)

Anyway...

He's so amazing. I love him so much, our 4 year anniversary is coming up on February 14. I got him his gift and it's currently in transit. I just wanted to say he's literally the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. I... live in an extremely toxic home, and I hate it, I'm not allowed to date but I don't care, I fell in love with someone, and we've been together almost 4 years now. He's so amazing...He's so kind, and charming, and passionate, and loving, and willing, and handsome and cute and literally any positive thing you can think of. He has no flaws. He's so perfect in my eyes. He's been there for me when literally no-one else has.  I couldn't be more thankful. I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we've been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR's silly, but he's my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that's alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that's all I really need. He's literally my best friend. He's been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn't much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don't really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it's rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I've been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He's so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I'm feeling even if I don't tell him initially. He tells me he's proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I've been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it's so silly to think that you're first relationship is the one you're gonna marry. But I so truly believe he'll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven't felt sad, like ""unneeded"" sad, of course I have days, but he's literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my ""spark"". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don't think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he's done...I'm overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or ""I know I'm all these things, but so are you"" He knows me, he knows who I am, he's the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can't love right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'll stop there for now, I could novels upon novels about my love for him, but I think now is a good time to stop.

238,"I want to end my lifeI just need to vent I have no one I can tell this to.

I moved back home to my grandmas after a stressful two years of college and a failed relationship due to drug addiction on both parties. We were both insanely depressed, I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse. I miss him so much it hurts. He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard he‚Äôs doing better but I‚Äôve decided to go no contact, but I miss him so bad maybe I‚Äôll do minimal contact once he‚Äôs feeling better.. I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but it‚Äôs gone out of control since moving back home. My life has no direction or meaning. All I do is bother everyone. My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus. Getting out of bed is insanely difficult. Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me, I know it‚Äôs my head playing with me man. I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it. It‚Äôs hard making friends and I don‚Äôt want to bother my friends down here. 

I had a decent job paying me 15 an hour but it was insanely stressful, when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me 10 dollars an hour. It‚Äôs definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me. My thoughts eat my alive.

I hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel 10x worse. The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end. We smoked after and chatted for a bit. Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep, well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours. It felt so good to be high again. Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore, I got no sleep, and my emotions are completely out of control. I‚Äôm usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day. 

Housekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there. I told them to call them because I was busy, but they stood behind me for 10 minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because they‚Äôre english is bad and they wanted me to do it... they were communicating with me just fine. So I snapped and said ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do?! Did y‚Äôall call them like i told you?‚Äù they said they called the gm and my boss but they didn‚Äôt answer their phones and they left a voicemail. So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier, and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss, so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her. I said I only called her because him and the other boss didn‚Äôt answer their phones, and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldn‚Äôt tell us to call them whenever they aren‚Äôt there if we need help if they don‚Äôt want to help. So what‚Äôs the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board, I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I can‚Äôt help them and to please go away.

I had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling. It wasn‚Äôt meant to be a suicide note, but I did mention how I wanted to do it. Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested, I want to drive far away listening to music until I‚Äôm tired, then I want to drive into a body of water and drown. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work. I‚Äôm too coward to shoot myself or hang myself. I don‚Äôt want my family to find me. If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees. I thought I closed the word document, but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasn‚Äôt attached to my body. So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at 11:55 last night and I‚Äôm wondering if that is why. Why else call me at that hour. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking. 

So now I‚Äôm thinking should I not show up to work? Maybe have a me day? I don‚Äôt even know how to have a self care and love day. I‚Äôm just too scared to go to work :( I don‚Äôt know if anyone would even care to read this. I feel so lost and lonely. If anyone wants to talk, I‚Äôd be so happy to...",suicide

let me start by a brief intro

im 14 and live in canada. i have shitty fucking parents and i have no life

my life is a repetition of study 24/7 then piano 24/7 and secretly game 24/7 (yes im asian, korean to be exact), swim 24/7 and read boring ass classic books 24/7

so my teenage years are looking like theyre gonna get fucked and i dont think i can handle me getting old as well

so i thought of this brilliant idea that if i dont want to get old, ill just kill myself

before all this, i always thought that death was interesting. i read a lot of articles about death and read philosophical korean manga about death.

im curious to what happens to 'me' after death.

i dont think this curiosity and this low key depression will go away

so ill just enjoy my life till late 20s then just kill myself.

I know, I know, nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them - but dang, I'm not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often.  At all.  So when I do, and I know I'm not doing well, it feels like I'm missing an incredibly important game changer for my life.  Yet, here I am again.  Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything.  And this one going wrong is just another lump.  Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me.  Another nail in the coffin, as it were.

And it's not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior.  I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job, and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties.  And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl...holy crap, I'm an idiot.  And a creep.  Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago, and, during one of our drunken conversations, she told me how I was like ""a little brother"" to her.  Of course, this makes my heart swell with pure joy, but then I wonder how creepy does that make me?  I'm just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy.  The past two nights, I'd go out drinking and just tell myself (aloud unfortunately) how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with.  It upsets my friends who were drinking with me.  They genuinely do care, but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too.  Who can blame them?  It's terrible.  And the more I think about it, the worse I get.  And the worse I get, the more I think about it.  My descent into pure, unadulterated, 100% self hatred is nearly complete.  All of this boils down to one question - ""Am I ever gonna be good enough?""  It just doesn't seem like the case.  Anytime I get a good opportunity thrown my way, I don't know how to handle it.  I've failed to adapt to society and the world.

Some people are still crazy enough to care about me for some reason though - probably mostly thanks to biology, but I've been slowly pushing away my family in addition to my friends and coworkers.  This is nobody's fault but mine, I know that.  I just don't want to hurt anyone.  I'd rather not put my parents through losing another child.  But, once I've got a safe enough distance between my family and me, I may genuinely consider checking out.  It's definitely become a legitimate, daily consideration again.",suicide

269,"Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast/presence? Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television?

Just a disclaimer, I am African American. I‚Äôm sharing an observation and this isn‚Äôt an invitation for a racist discussion.

2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice. All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud.

Obviously, companies see these protests and come out in support and that‚Äôs fine. But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity.

I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family. I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast. I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students. And many other commercials that you wouldn‚Äôt usually see a black face on.

This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race. I‚Äôve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform). 

Maybe I‚Äôm reading too far into it but it‚Äôs just what I noticed on television. Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress. It‚Äôs upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when it‚Äôs convenient to show that you support an agenda.",non-suicide

281,"Does anyone else feel like they were neglected by their parents just because you were never a problem child? I know this isn't really a thing to complain about, but i've always wondered if anyone else felt the same

I wa thirdborn in my family and homeschooled for the first 10 years. My mother had to school my rwo older brothers before I came into the world and this whittled down my mothers patience. By the time I was needing to be schooled, my mother was already busy enough with my other brothers that she didn't have the capacity to give me very much attention. 

By the time I was able to read well on my own, my mother would just plop a textbook down in front of me and I would go ahead and study on my own. I learned rather quickly that my mother had little patience when I asked for help twice in a row, or took too long to figure out easy stuff. Yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so I stopped asking for help altogether. 

From that point on, almost everything I did was on my own. I would start to fear help itself so I would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that I was studying just to avoid help altogether. 

It wasn't just with studying. I was for some strange reason really sensetive to yelling and I would prefer a beating rather than a scold on pretty much every occasion. Because of this, I learned cery quickly how to be a good boy in the house, not making any trouble whatsoever. Never causing problems and never having any that I had to ask assistance with.

I had fun by myself in those times. Jigsaw puzzles and puzzle books and jacks and whatever other 1 player games I could find, I played them. Keeping all the possible problems I could cause to a minimum.

A decade down the line, i'm now older and in high school. I do exceedingly well in every class and never cause a problem for anybody. I do find myself without a social life which I considered to be a waste of energy at the time. I've also noticed that all my exceptional achievements are going pretty much unseen by my parents. I believe that they just got used to how I was never a problen and now its standard in their eyes. I grew up always being great and pushing into greatness even further is exceedingly difficult.

Now i'm 19 and I feel in sort of trapped in this image I created for my parents that I ""must always be perfect"" and ""never cause a problem"". I've worked so hard to keep this image but I feel like its tearing me down.

I feel really down all the time now. I just feel so unmotivated and unhappy. The ""good boy"" in me says to ignore all that emotional bs and just keep moving along, but its harder and harder to do that every passing day. I just feel depressed. I hide it all from my parents because this would be an issue that I would be putting onto them. ""Sorry mom, but your 3rd child has a problem"". Also, I don't even know if theyll care.

And looking back on this whole situation, I feel like I have only myself to blame. I feel like I was the one who caused my parents to not care about me because I never wanted them to care about me and I avoided it whereever I could.

I'm the one who caused them to look at me the way they do.

283,"The Cold Sore Did Me InLet me prefix this with saying that cold sores are not that bad, but it was enough to push me over the edge. 

So, I've only for sure had one, and I may have had one or two more about a month or two later--but they didn't have apparent symptoms. The point being is that I haven't had anything since my first initial outbreak two years ago. Combine this fact along with the fact that I thought 80% of the population already had it, and that it was very rare to give it when you do not have symptoms. I was wrong. Only 60% of the US population has it (40% is far to high for me to just not care), and you can fairly regularly give it when you have no symptoms. So, now, if I ever want to kiss a girl again, I have to warn her that I've had cold sores, and I also need to avoid oral sex because I might give my partner it down there even without any open sores. 

So, this news is too much for me. I'm already miserable at my job (I've been looking for new work for three months now--my city's economy is horrible). My friend groups are breaking down (mainly people moving away or getting into relationships and forgetting about their single friends). I am not close with my family. And now, I can't even date because I'm a disgusting man who might give you cold sores. 

No, I am not the ""typical"" person who you find on this subreddit. I have numerous hobbies, I stay in shape, I (I guess now formerly) was successful with women, and I had quite a few friends. But I'm lonely. I've lost my three closest friends in a span of six months (one moved, one hates me now, and the other decides that his gf is all that matters in life), and they really were like family to me--especially important since I'm not close with my own. Professionally, I'm going no where and will probably be laid off in May, and, based on my city's job market, I won't be able to find work. Therefore, I am about to become an unemployed and lonely man who is undatable. 

It's the calmness--that's how I know that I'm close. The despair makes you unable to do anything, but the calmness let's you have the energy to end it. Thanks for reading, I appreciate you taking the time. ",suicide

still, i've never been able to completely move on from thinking about suicide: in the best of times, it's distant and amusing-to-think-about, in the worst it's a seriously-considered recourse. i just can't seem to feel fulfilled by any of my relationships, any of my accomplishments. even though i imagine by most accounts i'd be considered a happy, sociable, well-liked person, i feel like i just want to tie up my responsibilities, distribute my things, and get lost. almost unconsciously, i imagine the feeling of the barrel of a gun on the roof of my mouth, or what it would feel like to jump off a bridge or jump into traffic.

I don‚Äôt care about the consequences of my life anymore. It‚Äôs nice to not care about all the little things that used to make me hate myself. Now when I screw things up, instead of feeling like crap, and just think about how it won‚Äôt matter in the long run since there won‚Äôt be a long run.

The Islands are likely alive and they demonstrate their lives by changing position and shape every 279 years. The Island is inhabited by a tribe of natives called ""the Wave Missionaries. In 1478 DC another group of humans came to the islands and pillaged most of them, in 1480 began a war  between the Wave Missionaries and the aggressors.  The Missionaries were led by Hato, the best swordsman in all the Islands, who was gifted by the Wave a set of divine powers. The aggressors came from a never specified location and were led by Irwin Wardlock. The war ended in 1487 after the fall of Fort Hijo. After that Hato decided to pass down his powers to his family. In 1501 he mysteriously disappeared leaving a note saying ""I'll return, I just listened to the Wave calling me, it was not a pleasant invitation. It was a scream of pain"". 371 years later a city is founded after the alliance of the Missionaries and another batch of humans called Londinium. 28 years later a relative of Hato, Grica Wallace Irwin, sets out to find the truth behind the shady actions of duke Abraham Lucas and the fate of his long lost ancestor , Hato",non-suicide
337,"My suicidal thoughts.I am typically a person who tends to internalize a lot of my problems and do not usually express when I am feeling depressed or sad. However I do want to express these problems and talk about them. I know I need help with this because I have obsessed over these thoughts for years now. I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not, wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head. I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic. Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it's almost no wonder they do. But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy, so easy compared to most people's it's pathetic. I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day. The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up. Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood. But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering. And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant. So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time. So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn't awful? I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I'm real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I'll die. I just feel so lost, I am trying to find a path in life where I am not doomed to suffer the majority of the time and live for those small bits of time where I can do what I please. I want to live for what I like all the time but I'm afraid that's too greedy, too much to ask for, the majority of people don't how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence? Does it even exist? Am I chasing after something that can never be attained? And if that's the case how do I endure the suffering? Because I feel like I am weaker than the majority I am pathetic when compared to the majority. People have endured so much more than I have yet they still have the will to move forward when I am here wallowing in despair over the inevitable suffering I will face in the future. One day I fear when I finally face my moment of profound suffering it will give me the willpower to end my life.

We broke up because she constantly lied to me, she didn't show up when we planned to go out the day after I tried to kill myself. She didn't come to school for over two weeks and she went out with her ""friend"" who she promised she would stay away from as she keeps trying to make her take drugs.

It got to the point where on the night I broke with her, I flipped a coin, if it were heads I would break up with her and if it were tails I would kill myself. Thankfully it was heads but I'm getting back to that stage again. At school I have no friends anymore, when I try to approach anyone to try to become friends with them they just tell me to fuck off or something like that, so at lunch I just wonder about on my own and everyone just points and laughs at me

Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...

Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!

She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.

She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world; the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time, the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself, the vast majority that feel no empathy. I see all of these reflected in myself too, another idiotic follower of the human condition, driven purely by emotion and not by logic. Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding.

I was born too early to escape it, too. Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible, and I could just leave this hellhole behind, and things may have been different. But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances, unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of.

Only music and video games have stood between me and this. They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it, so I didn't have to deal with it. But they haven't worked now for a good few months. The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me.

This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought. The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world. Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this.

Nothing I have tried has helped. No antidepressants, no therapy, no thought mechanism has eased the pain. The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man, and now I am at wit's end. Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid, so what's the point in even trying to live with it.

412,"This is the only place I can talk about thisUsing a throwaway account because I need to get this off of my chest but I‚Äôm scared of speaking out fully as people I know irl know my reddit account. 


For the last five years I‚Äôve been slowly growing more and more sad and upset with life due to my own stupid mistakes. 

I have a loving family and sure we don‚Äôt always get along but I love them all to pieces.

The stupid mistakes I made haunt me to this day, no one knows about them besides me and the people involved, and that kills me. I have so many passions I want to pursue, like my singing or my art however I‚Äôm terrified that if my face gets out there one day I‚Äôll wake up to hear everyone I love knows what I did. 

I was so so fucking stupid and if I could go back I would have stopped myself. It was only five years ago I found out what I did shouldn‚Äôt have happened, that I should have never done it and since then it‚Äôs been creeping up on me and eating away at me. 

I can‚Äôt tell anyone about it who I care about and if I went to see a doctor and looked for help, I‚Äôd be scared someone would find out, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôd break down, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôd lose my place in college.

I‚Äôve thought about killing myself so many times, I even tired not taking my crohns and colitis medication for a while, hoping this illness would kill me slowly, but kill me none the less, but my mother soon found the full pill boxes and injections. 

It feels like a huge weight is being dropped on my head. I wasn‚Äôt forced to do what I did, I was a stupid child who didn‚Äôt know what they were getting into or how bad what they were doing was. I was naive and now it‚Äôll haunt me for the rest of my life, however long that‚Äôll be anyways.

I am not right wing in any way, but I can see how people can turn into bitter far right racists with equally terrible views from this. I hate people who claim to have an open mind but have no room accepting that people with different opinions exist. My comment on r/niceguys may have been unpopular, and I'm not offended by what people say, just shocked that grown adults can be such shitty people hiding behind a screen.

When I was in middle school I was relentlessly bullied. On my second year of college I was diagnosed with Luekemia. Unfortunately, it didn't kill me. My mom and dad divorced and it was so ugly. After I dropped out I realized I was trans. Now every day someone says something to me about how I'm a pervert or a freak. People online are so vile. My anxiety has been ruthless since I was a child. I can't hold a job because I get too scared to go in after the 3rd day. I'm 25 years old, don't have a job, can't keep one. I'm fat. I'm bald. I'm trans. I don't have any worth because I can't labor and so I'm just a parasite on my dad and mom. Every job I attempt (dozens) ive failed at. Its so much. When i do work i come home crying, and in the mornings before i go in i get so scared I throw up. But you need money to live and I dont wanna keep being a burden and pathetic

I don't know what to do. I've tried dozens of medications. Multiple therapists. I was on disability for a while for the cancer, but it ended now. I'm too anxious to leave the house. I'm too anxious to make phone calls or work or do anything. What options do I even have left besides killing myself?

426,"Should I leave a note?I am a 20 year old female. My parents decided that it was a good idea to have a baby with someone they met at AA and subsequently divorced when I was 4. I've been in therapy since I was 8. My first psychiatric inpatient admission was when I was 16 but once I graduated high school, everything went downhill. 

I've tried university but it's so lonely. I'm supposed to be in my 4th year but I barely have enough credits for a single year. I was in the gifted program so all of my high school friends are out there achieving great things and I'm just here binging and purging. Since I've turned 18, I've spent aprox. 10 months, mostly of a form(involuntary), in a psych ward. I've tried ECT twice and I'm only 20. I'm scared that it gave me brain damage because my memory is still fucked. I've tried about 20 different medications. 

Well, I see a social worker, psychiatrist, and a therapist weekly. I'm on disability. Would it really be that much of a surprise to my loved ones? It'd be selfish of them to want me to continue to live this way. I'm diagnosed with Bipolar II, BPD and Bulimia Nervosa. I am just a failure and a burden. There is nothing to look forward to except misery. My friends leave me. My mother just complains about how much money I cost her. Everyone is going to die and I have such trust/abandonment issues that I cannot trust my bf not to cheat on me. 

I can't tell my psychiatrist that I got the pharmacy to refill that bottle of pills security wrestled from me because he will just put me back on a psych ward. I just want to die. There is no hope at all. I don't want to wait until I'm 30 and just be in a worse position. There's no god because a god wouldn't let someone live in such agony. What have I done to deserve this? I try to go to school and smile but it just feels like I am attempting to evade my destiny.

Besides a living will that will say to take me off life support if heavily brain damaged, is there much point in leaving a note at this point? It's pretty much expected at this point.

444,"My life is falling apartHi all, 

This is my first and maybe last post on here. I‚Äôve had a pretty easy life. I went to good schools. I have wealthy parents who always loved and supported me and pushed me to do the best in life. I have a girlfriend of 2 years who I love so much. I worked in Canary Wharf ( UK Version of Wall Street ) as a foreign exchange broker for over a year and I was pretty good at it. I left that job a few days after I turned 21 to start my own brokerage. I have a group of friends who are always there for each other, my friends are my second family. We always have each other‚Äôs backs. My life should be perfect ya know. Middle class white boy with his entire life in front of him. Then it changed.

A few months ago I was involved in a car accident with a cyclist. I was driving home from my girlfriends on Mother‚Äôs Day and just didn‚Äôt see them. I missed the first one somehow but hit the front cyclist. They died a week later in hospital. In a few weeks, after the police have concluded their investigation I am going to charged with Death by Dangerous Driving. It carries a minimum of 2 years in prison and a lengthy driving ban. Due to coronavirus the firm helping me setup my own brokerage has folded, I lost all the money  I had already invested into my firm from website design and the such, which was pretty much everything I had. My girlfriend is leaving me due to the fact I‚Äôm going to prison for 2+ years. She‚Äôs also leaving me for a guy she works with, turns out they‚Äôve been having an affair since early December... and he sexually assaulted her. Apparently I‚Äôm just that bad of a boyfriend she wants to leave me for someone who sexually assaulted her. Most of my friends no longer talk to me due to the accident and the stress of the entire situation is putting a huge strain on my dads already very weak heart. My mum cries most morning and nights over it. 

I‚Äôve always felt like I was a burden on people my entire life. I feel like I‚Äôve let people down my entire life. I wish I could be someone different. My brother for example. He is a national swimmer, he has a masters degree in motorsport engineering and is currently an assistant lecturer. He has a house he rents with his friend in Coventry. My parents were always so proud of him. Although I said earlier that my parents loved me and supported me they have never been proud of me. They found out I smoked in year 9, I was never part of a sports team in school, I wasn‚Äôt popular. They felt I wasted my potential playing video games and going out with the few friends I had. 

So basically I‚Äôve decided to end it. My entire life I‚Äôve let people down, disappointed people and now everything is falling apart around me. I‚Äôve lost my friends, my girlfriend, my company and soon I‚Äôm going to lose my freedom. I had everything and now I have nothing. I used to be sure of everything and where I wanted to go in life, I wanted to bring my friends and family and girlfriend along with me. 

Now it‚Äôs just me. Alone in the dark, lying in bed at 1:42am on a Tuesday morning. I‚Äôm not sure when I‚Äôll go through with it, maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks or maybe when I‚Äôm in prison.

A little back story. I spent 3 years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights, drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking. One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka. I don't remember much about that night. I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible. I woke up to a trashed apartment. I gave my landlord my 30 day notice, submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job, told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me (for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with) and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse. I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good. I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier.

I made a miscalculation though. I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody. Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers, supervisors, and politics I had to deal with. I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this. We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust. I'm afraid to tell her anything now because I'm afraid I'll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking.

I'm in the same rut I was before, I feel desperately alone and depressed. The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months. Its hard to not beat yourself up when you've lived alone, isolated from about a dozen people for three years.

 I feel like all my hard work has been futile now. I stopped going to the gym, I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape. (The constant introspection began to drive me mad.). I feel like nothing has changed. I'm still miserable and I'm still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker. I haven't felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment. I'm worried if it gets worse I may take up drinking heavily again and try to drink myself to death.

Well, I'm not ""alone"", I have many people around me, I'm lonely. I was dating a guy who was just like me. He left me, so I would get better. He thought he was dragging me down more. He was the only one who made me feel better. I miss him a lot. It's been 6 months and I still feel just the same way about him. I'm tired of people telling me ""you will get over it"" and telling me I will find someone better. I won't. I have never felt attracted to anyone ever before in my whole life, except for him.

It's not the breakup, it's the loneliness combined with all of my problems. Things just keep getting worse for me day by day and I just feel lonely. I wish I still had him, it was all I needed. I just can't get through this alone. I can't. It's too much.

492,"I feel like everyone has given up on me, so why should I live anymore?Last week, I had a falling out with my girlfriend. I thought she was cheating, and in reality I was just way to suspicious and judgemental. She says we are fine, that it was an honest mistake, but she hasn't answered my calls or texts for a few days. My parents think I'm fucked up, that I have to steal from them. It's just small amounts of food, but they grounded me for a month. Now, I have to cancel all my plans and I'm too embarrassed to tell why. My bandmates have given up on me, they found someone better to replace me. My grades are falling fast. Is it better to just kill myself? I don't think anyone will care, and I won't have to face people anymore. I think I'm going to do it",suicide

495,"Back here again...I don't know if this happened on its own or because I quit the meds that I don't think I need. They all say I'm bipolar and give me these bullshit placebo pills that have hardly done anything. I seriously doubt I am, and so I quit the meds that I don't need. I don't experience the very common triggers, nor do I experience the physiological and emotional extremes associated with that disorder. It's all a misdiagnosis. I know it. I don't care if three doctors agreed with it, it's all wrong. These are the wrong meds and they are going to ruin me.

The thoughts came back. I keep going through almost cyclical periods of wanting to go through with a gender transition, only to completely lose interest weeks or months later. I don't know which side to trust. I was going through treatment for it, but I ended up quitting for some stupid fucking reason. Now it's flaring up again. When it flares up now, it flares up to an EXTREME extent. I can't make rational decisions, my emotions are very unstable, and I become suicidal and engage in self-harm. These periods can last from a week to a few months. I don't understand why it's so intense. I literally cannot focus on ANYTHING else besides the idea of transitioning. The thoughts plague me night and day. It haunts me in my sleep. I'm afraid to go to sleep now. I just can't do it. I don't want this to be any worse. It will only get worse as long as it's not being treated.

I'm almost certain this is going to get worse and it's only the first day of this 'flare-up'. I'm in an incredible amount of distress right now. The suicidal thoughts are starting to come back. I can't relax and breathe. I can't get anything done. It's transition or die. There is no other option.

I won't be able to transition in the near future. By then the treatment will have a minimized effect on me. I was fine before this two years ago. It worked. I was fine. Then I wasn't. I'm fucking done with this shit. I'm done. I want to end it. I don't give a shit about anything else at this point. I don't even know how to do it since anything I could use has been removed from the house after previous attempts. But I know I'll find a way if this gets worse. I don't know where this is going to go and I'm kind of scared. I don't want to end up back in the psych ward.

It's not just this stupid transgender crap that's fueling this. I also have a bunch of other psychiatric problems that are keeping me from getting anywhere in life. My therapist even told me that out of all her patients I have the most problems. Thanks doc. I'm told I shouldn't expect to be able to sustain a real 9-5 job that pays well. It's either part-time min wage servitude or disability. Either way I won't be able to pursue the gender transition. This leaves me with no choice. It's going to end soon. ",suicide

499,"It feels like it's creeping up on me, not sure how much longer I can go on with it.It's been exactly a month since my mother died at the age of 51. I always considered myself to not have to worry about the scenario until I was in my 30's, but here I am dealing with it at the age of 19. I've been criticized and pointed out at how well I'm coping with all of this happening for me, but deep down inside I'm hurt like the rest of them, I'm just desensitized from all the quarrels, problems, and depression leading up to it, not to mention nightmares almost every single night since then.

It used to be just my mother, myself, and my brother all living together. My father left because of a relationship dispute some time ago when I was younger, but he has still been there for me. But since this has all happened, it has felt like nothing but control over the situation. He doesn't want to support me and my brother financially while he's the only one with a job right now, and he can't support us socially because he lives in another city. The most he's done is tell us to get a job and start manning up to the responsibilities that my mother used to take care of, but to be fair, neither me or my brother have had the willpower to do anything since. I want to go and see a grievance counselor with my brother, but procrastination, depression, and anxiety has been getting the better of both of us, and I doubt my father would be willing to help in that regard.

I feel really broken right now. Unable to work and keep up in today's society. Everyone's pushing us forward, telling us what to do, how to do, what we need. I feel it's only a matter of time before either me or my brother hatches an idea and it plays out like some sort of dramatic movie. I asked my brother today how is he feeling today, on a scale from 0 being like any other day, to 10 being that he knows today is his last. He replied 8, I replied 6, although that's probably just the desensitization talking, and I'm probably more closer to 8 or 9.

I feel like this is all revolving around money. It doesn't feel right at all, especially considering that my mother used to get paid spousal support, and she'd spend that money on me and my brother. It now goes all back to my dad and haven't seen anything since. I've tried speaking up against my dad about this, but the most he does is hold what little he supports us on right now over our heads and asks if we want his support or not.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to live. I definitely don't know how to help myself. A lot of these things, I would have asked my mother to hold my hand and help me do them. She would give me so much support through it until I was able to do it myself, but now all I get is tough love.",suicide

I ended up going to a psych ward as I thought I would and I just got out yesterday. I was telling them that I felt better, when in reality I still feel like killing myself. I just didn't want to be in there anymore because the doctor didn't give a shit. I told him that I wasn't feeling good when he asked how I was doing, and he said ""If I went to the grocery store, and asked how the clerk was doing, I expect them to say good, because that's the polite thing to do. I don't want to hear their whole life story all I want to do is pay for my thing"" which made no fucking sense because it's not a grocery store it's a fucking psych ward. I'm supposed to be honest with how I am feeling. After that he quickly wrapped the conversation up and the next day he would talk about his life. He clearly didn't give a fuck.

So TikTok is a place if you're willing to see porn. Otherwise go elsewhere safer because you're not supposed to go on TikTok at school.

515,"Suicide is not an option for me. That's not just a tired saying, it's my reality. But if it's the only thing I can think about, where do I go from here?I cross-posted from r/depression. I'm sorry if you see this twice. 

I've been lurking here on my main for a long time, and I don't know that I fit in. I'm sorry if my situation isn't relatable. It sounds really stupid.

I have a great life. I know many people are alone but I'm not, no matter how much I keep trying to be. I try to push my friends and family away but I can't. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazing.

Suicide is absolutely not an option for me. I have too many people who care about me (I know, I know how this sounds). Once my dad and grandma pass away, then it's very much on the table - friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it. However, my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy, I've got a couple decades before that becomes a reality. Sometimes I resent that, and that's the darkest thought I've ever had. I've never told anyone this before, but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad - my favorite person in the *world* \- is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way, because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too, and I really don't want to.

I'm also gainfully employed, in a job I used to love, and really should still love. I'm not wealthy but I can support myself. My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people, my boss is a good person, I believe in the work, and it pays the bills even in my very expensive city.

I have friends, and the ability to have more friends, but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people away.

I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I have to keep it all up - working, being a normal person, or faking it as best as possible. I isolate myself a lot, I never go out, but still my friends are there. It's very weird and confusing. I don't know how I got so lucky. Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them, but they're all very cool people - they're intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives. I don't know how I've tricked all these people into being my friends, or how I've tricked my job into keeping me employed, or how I've tricked my family into being so supportive. But I have, and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyone.

I don't want to be alive anymore. Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks. Every time I'm alone, and I'm alone *a lot,* all the same. But I don't know what to do. I feel so fucking trapped. But my amazing, supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this - and they'd probably have me committed. They'd probably try to make me quit my stressful job, as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job (which is stressful, yeah, but a mentally healthy person could handle this - hell, even a slightly-more-healthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it). Then I'd have nowhere to go, nothing to do. My friends and family would get tired of me and I'd be in the same situation as so many people who are alone.

It's like I've got it backwards. I have no reason to be depressed right now, but I am, cripplingly so. But if I tell anyone, my life will be turned upside down and I'll have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was 12.

I just... don't know where to go from here. I'm sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow. And I'm sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging - I don't understand why I've gotten so unfairly lucky in life, either. I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them. I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me. I know that sounds awful.",suicide

I've fucked up every opportunity life has ever given me. Everything to me seems stupid and pointless and I can't seem to find enjoyment out of anything that doesn't involve deep fantasy where I can forget who I am for brief periods of time. 

My parents sent me to two different schools and I fucked up each of them for years and got no degree. I have no real skills that can get me a job, I've been unemployed for two years straight almost. I finally got a job four months ago and got so stressed out at a night time security guard job that I had to quit it was making me so incredibly miserable. I'm pathetic and I have no idea why I was feeling what I was feeling. I can't put it into words, I'd just go to the job and start to feel panicked. I ended up having to find an excuse to quit even though my parents asked me not to. 

Now I'm sitting here jobless wondering what do I do? Even if I get a job is it going to stress me out to the point where I can't handle it? Probably. My father thinks I'm a fucking loser and a disappointment even if he won't come right out and say it. He's ashamed of me and that crushes me, but there's nothing I can do. Shame is something I've come used to, it scares me less than the stress I am going through. 

I've never had a girlfriend, I've never really kissed a girl, I've never had anyone love me back. I've never had someone I could put my arm around and say ""I love you too"" to me. I live completely alone without another living soul around me. I didn't used to drink until I started that job four months ago and now I do it just to feel 'normal'. Like just doing what everyone else does when their depressed makes me feel slightly better. 

I've been laying completely in the dark for hours crying because I have no hope for the future. I'm almost 30 years old and there's nothing good out there coming. I've squandered every opportunity I've been given and it's just too late. I'm a burden to everyone around me. I tried to tell my parents how I felt around the holidays but they didn't get it. They were worried for a few days and kept asking me over and over how I felt until I finally said 'better' and then they figured I was past it all. I wasn't. 

They told me I need to talk to someone, but I can't afford to go talk to a professional. And even if I did, where do I start? How does a professional take my fucked up life and make me want to live it? There's no digging myself out of this hole I'm in. I'm stuck and I'm going to stay stuck. It's too late for me to start changing, too late for me to get a girl, too late for me to fix how I get when I go in public. So fuck it, right? 

I'm crying and screaming at the top of my lungs and I just don't know how to make it all stop. I don't know why I'm putting this in the suicide watch Reddit because I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I want to do it, but I'm too afraid. I've tried before, but I always chicken out. I'm useless even at that. 

Again, I just don't know why I'm writing all this. I'm somewhat of a writer, maybe I'm hoping it'll make me feel better? I was wrong. Now I just feel embarassed ontop of it. Jesus, what do I do? Do I keep limping along, making people ashamed of me as I keep fucking everything up? Wouldn't it be BETTER for me to just end it? ",suicide

She told me that maybe we could try again but that she would need to make a big change in her life and isn't sure that it would ever happen.

534,"My chronic depression is getting worse... This world feels like a nightmare. [NSFL]I'm thinking about suicide a lot...

I want to be dead. I once thought that human problems were surmountable, but they're not. 

They're just not. I only want to live if I can think of a scheme in which humans aren't doomed, and I can't. I've tried and I can't, and that depresses me. Everyone I've ever loved is going to die; I'm going to die. Everyone works hard for things, which they forget about when they die. Everyone feels pain. There's so much agony in the world. So much madness. Small animals by the millions are being poured into grinders alive; their meat comes flowing out a tube, like shit from an anus. Young children are beheading people, but tiny baby arms are so weak they saw the heads off slowly. And then other children listen to music that's merely people screaming. Screaming! This is a world of endless screaming. High-school graduations happen, and the young men and women without scholarships walk away, knowing that they will live lives of struggle, which will be harvested as tax dollars for the state, no differently than the way human batteries are harvested by the machines of The Matrix. The planet is suffering and the minds able to come up with schemes capable of reversing the damage being done are killing themselves. The leaders we elect have values, not plans or schemes. Human history is filled with torture, slavery, and suffering. I hate being human. Most of my friends are depressed because I find happiness intolerable: pathological happiness in the face of this worlds past, present, and future, seems like a crime to me. Every religion secretly prescribes nihilism. Humans exploit one another in life, because nature has been overridden by the state, thanks to human nature. And I feel worlds away from it all. I don't want to participate in human affairs, but go in direction completely opposite to wherever this leads. I don't have any hope for humans... I just hope... That this is all some kind of simulation, intended to teach me how not to behave. What if evolution made us miserable, so we could survive? I don't feel like anyone can relate to me. I don't feel human. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do for you. I don't understand why, as I've aged, I've become more sensitive, and not less. The adults who raised me were so stupid, that I assumed I would become numb when I grew old, but it seems like the complete opposite has happened. These feelings. Was I programmed to function in a smaller world? I drive down the street, and it scares me: that I have this urge to meet everybody I see, but I roll past them like they're nothing. And I'm nothing too. What's the point in being a nothing that feels something? And there's no such thing as help. People don't help; they help themselves by getting jobs. One of my only older friends, she's really jaded about life; she feels like it let her down. She told me that I should try not to obsess over these things (our world and universe is eating itself); that people who do, do end up killing themselves. I just can't though. It's getting harder and harder to wake up in the morning, and when I do wake up I'll go back to bed to cover up my disgusting self. I will delete this post, to cover up my disgusting self, but I promise I won't kill myself. I feel so torn, because I want to like existence, but I don't. And it's the only existence I know!

But I feel like I may as well be 50 already, just say bye to any semblance of youth i have. I don't think its right to my daughter to have a mom who doesnt wanna be here. I don't think it's fair to my boyfriend to have to deal with me. I will NEVER be happy away from her so leaving and starting over isnt an option. Cant undo my baby in my brain. But I will never be happy doing this either. I just want to quit. I want to die. I want her to have a better mom. I want her to not see anger from her mother. I want to not be conscious or aware anymore. I want to cease to be. But I'm terrified I'll do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar. If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death, I'd have done it long before now. And I've struggled w depression, bi polar, borderline personality, my whole life. I don't see it getting better. Just worse. So why stick around?",suicide

543,"I'm a disgusting piece of shit and here is my rant.I'm so fucking done. I recently moved to the other side of the country for my internship, better said: to work fulltime without even getting paid. I have literally nobody here; all my coworkers are at least ten years older (seriously), I can't join any sportsclub or other activities around here cause I'm not an official student so I'm not welcome there. All the parties and activities I'm welcome at, are full of old people (as in at least 40 y/o).

I was so glad that I got invited to celebrate the newyear at my boyfriend's appartment, but yesterday the flu kicked in. I was up the whole night (8pm till 5am) vomiting bile and it hurt so much that i even had to sleep sitting up. It was horrible. So, I asked him if he could please, just please, come over here, instead of having that stupid fucking party. But guess what, he'd rather be there ofc. He'll maybe come later tonight, around 11pm, just to fuck obviously. I know he's totally obsessed with the girls that are gonna come to that party ('I just think they're really interesting', yeeah well, especially with those seethrough dresses and giant push-up bras, right.), and it just hurts so much. I never felt wanted in my entire life, and even he, after all this time, won't spend time with me. He's probably gonna break up with me soon cause I'm a depressed, hidious piece of shit with no friends who's always yelling and ruining everything. 

Things were finally getting better for me; I quit drugs after using almost half of my life, I started to eat better and to exercise, but nothing helps. I'm still the same disgusting whore, and I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm probably just gonna go to that stupid party, eventhough it's two and a half hours by train and I've been vomiting my brains out for the past 24hrs. I just really want to feel like a whole person, okay. I don't want to die, but trust me, I want to, if you know what I mean :/",suicide

This is my first time posting ever. I need help. I've been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I take my pills every day. I'm surrounded by people that love me. I've been told I'm pretty, talented, funny, nice, etc. I have a boyfriend. I have a loving family that is paying for my college education (though I dropped out because the depression was so bad). I have a roof over my head. I was in a sorority surrounded by tons of friends. I used to be a division I athlete before I dropped out. Everything is right in my life.
Everything, except me. I'm miserable all the time. I honestly want to kill myself. I've tried twice to hang myself but it didn't work. All I got was the impression of a rope around my neck. I've never felt this down in my life. I think of all the mistakes I've made and I just wish I could go back in time and relive my life, knowing what I do now. I don't know what to do. If I didn't live in a state where it was so hard to get a gun I probably would have shot myself a long time ago.

557,"I'm a Worthless BastardToday, I really contemplated killing myself. It‚Äôs not the first time. I‚Äôve considered it a lot of times in my life and I always come up with some reason not to. My family needs me too much. I‚Äôd miss the new episode of my favorite show. For the longest time, the reason I was holding onto was that I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on Avengers Infinity War and then Endgame. It sounds so stupid now that I think about it. Then I saw it and, even though it wasn‚Äôt everything I thought it was going to be, I was mostly satisfied, and I forgot. It had been so long that I had forgotten that I was waiting for that movie to end things.

It wasn‚Äôt until today when I was sitting on the couch, at peace for once. I was genuinely content with myself at that moment. Then my sister came, and she was mad that I didn‚Äôt take her son to school today. He didn‚Äôt get a lot of sleep last night, had a really bad nightmare about his grandmother (on his father's side) who had recently passed. I decided to let him stay home since it wouldn‚Äôt be right to send him to school. My sister confronted me. She accused me of being lazy. She said that all I do is lay around and watch tv all the time. She brought up things; how I‚Äôd never finished school, how I didn‚Äôt have a job, how I didn‚Äôt have any friends, and that the only thing I had in this world was those stupid action figures that I collected. She called me a Worthless Bastard and said that I was going to grow old with nothing and that I better not expect her to take care of me when our mother eventually dies.

A worthless bastard. That really hurt. She thinks that I am a worthless bastard. My own sister. I waited until she left the house and then I cried. I really got to thinking about my life.

She's right. I don't have any friends. I dropped out of college to take care of my mom when she got sick and now I don't have a degree. I'm 23 and still a virgin. I've never even had a boyfriend cause no one ever wanted to ask me out. I was a home care provider for my mom but then I was fired when she changed insurances. No Job. No money. I fill out an application for places and get rejected. I go in for interviews and get rejected. I'm so tired of getting rejected.

I just hate my life. I hate everything about it. Every time I leave the house I just feel like everyone is laughing at me. They can all see how awful I am and are thinking about how much they hate me. I know I'm being irrational. It's just how I feel so I haven't left the house, other than to drop my nephew off at school and pick him up, in days and even then I don't get out of the car that way I don't have to face anyone. I just go home and hide.

I used to be so Smart. I think about how Smart I used to be. I think about my goals. My plans for my life. The things that I wanted to do. I was going to be a doctor. I was going to go to college out of state and It was my plan and I‚Äôd tell anyone who would listen about my plans.

I endured a lot of bullying growing up and people were always telling me that I was worthless. I was always going to be worthless. I remember in the first grade that I was excluded from games and I didn‚Äôt have any friends. The Bullying continued throughout Elementary and Middle School. Bullied at school and then bullied at home by my sister and my grandmother. All my life everyone has always told me that I was ugly. that I was stupid. That I was lazy. That I couldn't do anything right. That I was a dumbass. And whenever I'd cry I was called out for being sensitive. Why was I so sensitive? Why couldn‚Äôt I take a joke?  I was always a target, and there were days when I considered killing myself just for relief. But I didn‚Äôt. I stood in front of a mirror, tears in my eyes and I said, ‚ÄúNot yet. I can‚Äôt do that to my family.‚Äù

But I think about it now that I‚Äôm older. All my life, I was told that I had to take care of my sister. She has a mental disorder and my mom was always telling me that one day when I became a doctor that I had to support my sister. Look after her. I used to have nightmares about that. Nightmares where my mom was a ghost telling me to look after my sister. And after she had my nephew it became, ""Look after both of them.""

Now, I'm nothing. I didn't become anything. I didn't prove anyone wrong. I can't take care of anyone. I'm a waste of space. A worthless Bastard just like she said. I feel so worthless and tired. I hate myself so much. I just wish I was dead.",suicide
561,"Confusion, suicide and a sick petI‚Äôve been having a lot of suicidal ideation. It‚Äôs different this time though because I truly feel I‚Äôm not meant to be on this plane in existence. I finally realize that waiting out this pain is rather pointless because it‚Äôs going to re-emerge again and whatever contentment I find in the spaces between isn‚Äôt worth the darkness. I manic-depressive and I can‚Äôt trust my own brain, my mind. It‚Äôs the worst it‚Äôs ever been this time.

My cat stopped eating about a week ago. He‚Äôs going downhill and the doctors just figured out what‚Äôs going on but the situation is dire it‚Äôs probably too late. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Supposedly he has a 79% chance of bouncing back, but in the meantime he‚Äôs on a feeding tube that I have to tend to every hour and a half. And any other time in my life, I would jump on the chance to help my companion animal get through a hump like this to live. But right now, well I‚Äôm suicidal, I don‚Äôt know why am torturing him and torturing me in the process.

The vet said it‚Äôs not torture. That he looks worse than he is. I‚Äôm not concerned that this vet is bilking me for money, believe me. He really thinks that if we do the tube feeding for about a week that he could be fine for another three, or five, or 10 years. But I don‚Äôt want to be here another three, or five, or 10 years. I feel horrible that instead of snuggling with me like he‚Äôs always done, my cat Stays in one spot unless I‚Äôm coming to feed him and in that case he runs away. Like bolts away for me, running into things along the way because he has the Elizabethan collar on.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs good for him or me to keep doing this. I don‚Äôt know if I put him down, I might come to me angry that I didn‚Äôt do everything I could. And I don‚Äôt know if that outweighs the anger I‚Äôm going to feel if he is deteriorating to a point of no return and his last days with me are horrible. 

I fantasize about killing me and him. Why delay the inevitable? This pain isn‚Äôt worth it. We could be released from everything.

I've made my share of fuck ups, so of course to her parents I'm the crazy ex who they despise and want nothing to do with.

Yet she's always let me back in, she's always made my heart beat in a way that I never thought it could. She's made the coldest nights warm, and the most painful of injuries turn numb. But she lies. A lot. And I forgive her, I let her in, hell I let her walk all over me but she will suddenly claim one day a week that she wants nothing to do with me. This is how it's always been.

But this week pretty much ended it all for good. Her dad got involved and all kinds of shit (even though we're both 19, yet her parents need to control her life.)

So I'm left here alone, without even the utterance of a goodbye from the woman I've spent the last two years on. Trying to help her beat the battle of depression that I haven't even beaten myself.

583,"Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys, I am in a tough place right now. 

Quick background on me: I have moderate-severe clinical depression. Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation; before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time. I self-harmed every day. My symptoms are *completely managed* by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts. 

I just started dating someone (trans nonbinary, assigned female at birth) who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don't enter the planning/methods level of detail, which is good. 

I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren't medically accurate, and relies on me to be their ""antidepressant."" (I make them feel good when we see each other.) Obviously, I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship, but my SO's refusal to get medical care for their depression/using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health. 

They got upset at me (over text) when I said I couldn't meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week (I am in a very involved premed program). 

They live about 90 minutes away, so most of our communication is via text/video calls. A couple nights ago we had this exchange: 

SO: I want to die 

me: Do you think you're going to hurt yourself tonight? 

SO: I'm already hurting myself 

me (at this point, shaking because I am upset and afraid they're attempting suicide/self-harming): How? 

SO: I'm trying to write an essay, I can't type both. 

A similar scenario has gone down a couple times; my SO saying they want to die/""end my suffering""/""end me"" and then when I try to figure out what's going on, I'm called a ""nerd"" or told ""stop worrying about me"" (harshly) or even just ignored. One time, they said they wanted to kill themselves, I responded saying something like, there are other ways to make the pain get better, what can I do for you, and was met with ""what are you going to do if I kill myself, spank me?"" 

That message honestly made me sick to my stomach. 

I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me. I understand what it's like to be in that dark, awful place but I feel like I'm being played with, especially with the suicidal comments that, when I inquire about them, I am met with sarcasm or teasing. It is hurting me. I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so. 

What should I do, you guys? I don‚Äôt know what is going on, I don‚Äôt know if my SO is being serious or messing with me, I don‚Äôt know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage, and I don‚Äôt know if I should stay with them if this continues‚Äînot because they have depression, but because they won‚Äôt address it, against the advice of numerous medical professionals. 
We‚Äôve only been together a month. I really like them and am willing to be there for support, but I‚Äôm not an antidepressant. I‚Äôm a person with needs and a history of severe depression. I really don‚Äôt want to fall back into hurting myself. Please help me figure out how to navigate this.

I deserve to die and yet I live.  When I'm gone I know no one will mourn the same way for me.

All I want is to kill myself. I don't want to think about.. splitting up material bullshit.. or .. fuck man.. or even how we're suppose to talk to each other now. I'm madly in love with this woman but.. somehow it wasn't enough to overcome my own selfishness. I've ruined the only thing I've ever wanted, a real family. I don't know where I'm suppose to go.. how do I drive now that I'm leaving her with the car, the bills, the kids, my heart, fuck... everything is with this woman. I couldn't stand to see her happy with someone else, but I do wish her nothing but happiness. I just.. she's been kissing me and I was just told its because I want it. She doesn't even want to kiss me. I really fucked up. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I want more than what I've already taken in this life. I've struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts my entire life, and right when I think that I'm finally over it.. this happens. I am the bad guy here. I know I am and no matter how many tears I cry it'll never fix what I once had.

If I'm not going to kill myself, then I need to know how to do this. She works 40 hours during the week on days, and I work 2 12's on saturday and sunday so money isn't exactly easy to come by. What about my babies.. how does the mother of my children sustain their living situation and her own without me around to watch them while she works. I'm sure she'll find a way.

615,"It's just one more monthHey,

Was planning to post in /r/depression, but this felt more appropriate.

To sum up, I'm transgender, 20 years old, extremely severe depression, no treatment. Went off one of my anti-depressants a month ago due to side effects, asked my doctors office for an emergency appointment.

Still haven't heard from them. Things are worse than ever. Today I got out of bed, went straight into the bath and fell asleep. Five hours later I got up and went back to bed and slept until my mother got home.

After she walked the dogs, she asked me what I had for lunch. I considered lying, but I didn't have the energy. I told her that I had a piece of old stale bread for lunch, which was the truth. She got angry that I wasn't eating properly, not upset, not sad, angry. She then got angry I didn't empty the dishwasher.

After a while, she came back to my room and told me that she wasn't cooking dinner for me if I stayed in bed. I couldn't bring myself to respond, I just laid there. She's currently eating dinner, and I'm in my room still.

In a month I meet with the trans care people again. This time they might tell me that they've decided to treat me. Probably not though, it's been 2 years and they haven't moved a step in that direction.

I know that I would probably feel better if I actually managed to see my doctor and get another med. I know I probably wouldn't be spending the entire day sleeping and/or thinking about ending it. I can't bring myself to do anything, though. I can't pick up the phone. I can't eat.

I hate myself so much. My life is a complete failure. 
Sometimes it occurs to me in a flash that the idea of ending my life is an aberration as the gift of life is such a sacred and gorgeous thing, and I mean I really feel it in a deep way. 
Also I‚Äôm fully aware of my potential (which is in part why I despise myself so much). But in moments like now (and they‚Äôre getting more and more frequent and intense) all I can think of is my pain. 

The lack of socializing, physical affection and sex leads to a very real physical pain at this point. I feel it all over my body. Like a wave that envelopes me and ends up focusing right in my heart, like a frozen fist clenching suddenly around it. 

And believe me I‚Äôm not letting myself go. I‚Äôm fighting with all I got. I‚Äôve quit smoking (both cigarettes and weed), stopped fapping and watching porn, I exercize daily, meditate, take cold showers, go for walks, got back to photography, which was a big hobby of mine, and started seeing a therapist.

Add to that my family always being assholes to me because they think I'm crazy.  I also bottle up all the things about them that hurt me and drink to feel better, then eventually tell them off.

My brother beat my face for a solid 3 minutes, twice within 15 minutes, for saying shot that was true but he didn't like.  That was the day before Thanksgiving 2017.  I spent the next three days in bed thinking of how I was going to kill myself.  Nobody checked on me.

Now my mother and niece physically attacked me the other day, stole my phone and hid my car key.  I lost my job.  They think I'm making up what happens to me and the only thing really wrong with me is the drinking.

706,"I'm only 20 years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long.

I'm ""only"" (""only"" according to what people say) 20 years old, and even though I wouldn't say I feel ""old"" exactly, I'm always thinking about our finite youth, about ageing and our mortality. I can't get it out of my head.

A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they're 33, and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes, as a 30 year old, with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes. I'm inevitably miserable in these pictures.

I see people I like, admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises. I'm **extremely** scared of ageing, you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me. I'm scared of regrets, I'm scared of ending up a nobody, I'm scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally.

I can't stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future. I feel so much guilt when I'm not 100% efficient in what I'm doing. I feel so bad about myself, my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying. I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty, I hate myself for being too weak. I really REALLY want this thing but I'm so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can't pull through. I want it so much that I want to cry. It's more like a necessity than a mere desire.

The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating, but having to do the work exhausts me *emotionally*. I know at least one of the reasons why this happens (meaning perhaps there are others), but I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone, let alone publicly. The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown, with difficulty I partially told her my ""dream"", why I want it, and why it's so important to me, and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful.

It's not a crime or anything like that, but it's something I feel is ridiculous and laughable, something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am (or have become).

One of my fears is *having* to commit suicide in the future (between 2 and 4 years from now) due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt. I *know* I won't find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don't achieve my dream at least partially or if I don't achieve it in the time period I *need* to. This is because my goal heavily depends on my age, and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that. My goal is along the lines of ""enjoy your young years doing things that 20 years olds are"". Time itself is part of the ""specifications"" of my goal.

30 year olds or late 20 year olds hanging out with early 20 year olds is weird and unacceptable, and I wouldn't feel part of the group either. I want to hang out with 20 year olds AS a 20 year old, but right now I can't. I've already wasted so much time isolating myself for 6 years in my room with my computer, not hanging out with people my age, not gaining experiences, not making memories, but now what I want is something slightly different. And being so ""ambitious"" or ""demanding"" sometimes makes me feel bad too. Perhaps I'm just a spoiled kid who hasn't grown up yet and learned of life.

Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable, make peace with a life without this delusional, grandeur dream of mine, and live peacefully where I am. I know progress can't be accelerated so much, I do know it, but I so wish it could, you don't know much this pains me. Life is so painful, ageing is so painful, your face changing and getting more 30-year-old-looking is so painful. I want to stay this age forever, hang out with people my age all over the world, celebrate with them, suffer with them, talk with them, know of their dreams and fears, learn about their subcultures, be part of the group, etc.

That last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want, but yea, as you see, it's kind of stupid.",suicide

I can't even kill myself because if I did she goes to cps and gets placed in foster care. I like her enough and she's a good kid. I just can't do it. I am not up to this task.

My health is failing me in multiple ways. Developed allergies to wheat, tomatoes, fruits, rice, onions.....lots of plants. All I can eat is corn, oats, meat and potatoes, as far as I can tell. It isn't the type of allergy that will kill me either, imagine rolling around in fiberglass and feeling that way for two days or so after anything on the bad list. It sucks I hate it.

Finally got to quit being homeless 6 months ago.  Already lost my job and don't know or understand how to handle living real life in a real house.  It's harder to come back from than I'd ever thought possible.  I have no food, my state won't fund me food stamps, I don't talk to ANYONE outside of the internet, including my roommates, who were at one point great friends of mine and helped me get back on my feet in the first place.  The girl I want to marry gave me a second chance when I got back into a place to live, and I've already crippled my chances at anything long lasting through paranoia and fear.  I won't be able to pay my rent in a week, and although they said they'd cover my share this month so I can keep looking for work, I don't think I can take the embarrassment of feeling useless and I also can't face life on the streets anymore.  I'm deep in the red with debt and I owe bad people in a city near home money from my old long since kicked drug habit, however, I've been thinking about using constantly lately. (It dominates my thoughts.)  I've been in bed for almost two days straight crippled with depression and don't know what to do.  I can't even look anyone in the face without wishing they'd beat the living shit out of me for being such a piece of trash.

I saved a needle from when I used as a reminder, always, that I could beat drugs.  Now it's sitting there, full of bleach, like it has been for the last 3 days.  And it looks better and better every time I look at it.  I don't know what to do.  I don't.

754,"I'm mentally deficient and I refuse to live with it.Hi, I'm Steve. I'm 17, I live with autism and mental deficiencies, and I'm going to kill myself right after I submit this god damn post.

I'm not posting this because I want help. I'm posting this because these words need to go somewhere, and honestly I don't know of a better place where a message like this would be acceptable.

Back to the subject. I'm autistic, and I have some really bad mental deficiencies and it's fucking killing me on the inside. I took a cognitive test when I was 15. I have an IQ of 77, and I was ranked either ""Deficient"" or ""Borderline Deficient"" on everything. Fuck. It's so hard living with the fact that your limits are so fucking low compared to the rest of the general population and you will never fucking be able to achieve your dreams because of some bullshit that I can't fucking help.

I'm in the special education program at my school and I fucking hate it. They teach jack shit and group me with kids that screech and shit their pants. I can talk normally, I just don't want to unless I'm asked. I'm mentally fucking deficient but I want to be taught something that's above preschool level. I've tried telling my mom it's not enough for me but she just dismisses me and tells me I won't make it in mainstream education. I try telling my special ed teachers I want more, but they dismiss me too and then make jokes about me behind my back like I can't fucking hear them. Hey, Mr. Janssen, when you read this, fuck you. I heard every little bit of shit you talked about me. Mrs. Huang, fuck you. I heard you call me inbred. Ms. Baker, fuck you too. I get it, I'm not smart and I never fucking will be but I want to be taught more than fucking preschool shit. Fuck.

I'll say it again: you have no fucking clue how hard it is to live when you know that your limits are much much lower than the average person, you will never graduate high school, you will never go to college, and you will never get any respectable job, and generally your life will be very unfulfilling. I always dreamed of being a coder, but guess what? That requires you to be smart and guess who isn't smart? Me. I tried to teach myself. It doesn't click and while I love it I'm so fucking bad and it takes me hours to figure out things that are ""super basic"". I can't do it. It's too hard.

I'm not willing to live a life in which I can't be a normal person. I just want to graduate high school, go to college, get a good job, and just have a normal life. But all of that has been made inaccessible by the fact that I'm in fucking special ed and won't even graduate high school and will forever be dependent on my parents.

I don't want to burden my parents any more by being the dead weight piece of shit that I am. And I don't want to doom myself to a life of suffering.

so ya don't wreck my life and find out who i am. 

I just called a crysis hotline, and it was busy, lol and I called 5 more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times. then I found another line for some local crysis centre.

i used to work as a telephone surveyer, it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone, just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell. special one time offer! how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you.

actually that sounds terrible, I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can't see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem. so basically I am alone, I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares.

it's all up to you she says, wow what a thing to say to someone with depression, yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me, i know that my life is either shitty or it isn't based off my actions. I very much know that. why would I be depressed if I didn't blame myself? just fucking terrible, now I'm just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal.

it's like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house... well I work fulltime so that's not gonna work, and I don't have vacation days, and I work nights, so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever. well that's not really gonna work if I get up at 8-10pm and go to bed at noon-2pm

so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life, I actually don't mind my job, I actually like it there, it's the one safe spot in the world is work. I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat, I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since. but I know it's not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems. then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all, and then it's just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house, but why don't I just move out? well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn't work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I've maxed out my credit cards paying them rent(which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out.) I didn't even ask them to change their habits, I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it. this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying. have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog? and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter, just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration.

so now I'm stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt. I'm not even hopelessly in debt, I just can't leave here, but I can't live being this fat anymore, because nobody will love me, or even even affectionitly touch me, I don't even mean sex, I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female. you know I don't even blame them for regecting me anymore, they all actually out of their way nice to me

so ya whatever I guess, I'm taking some art classes, and I found out I'm very talented, lol I'm a very honest person in a way that's great on camera. But I'm fat and people don't have sympathy for fat people(well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss) if you just try to put them in a normal life situation, people inheritly react negatively, because fat people are ugly, I think it too

but ya I can't fix it. I know people won't accept this statement, but when I'm on my ""healthy diet"" I feel great and am not hungry because it's well balanced and not extremely low calorie. But I come home from work and it's just there is food and sugar everywhere, and as soon I get eating it, I want more and then i don't care because I think I've already fucked it up for myself, I might as well just eat more so I don't feel bad.

and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible, I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won't seem like unenjoyable effort. and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don't want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better. so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get 3 double cheeseburgers and each has 400 calories, that's 1200 calories I can eat in I dunno. 4 stop lights away from the mcdonalds. and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs. on top of the regular diet which is about 500 under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around. then all of a sudden I'm like 2000 calories over my needs and then that's evey day, and that's like all in the last 3-4 hours of the day. and the next day maybe I just don't care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two 400 calorie energy drinks. and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash.

 it's just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me, they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself. but if I ever try to just anything, just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction. I know we're in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don't hate me, because I act like I think you hate me, but it's not because you hate me, it's because I love(yes I know I don't know what the word means but I like to use it) you and you'll regect me and it's easier for me to perceive it as hate, and you go out of your way to say it isn't and you care that little bit. and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it's just this natural reaction and attraction, no desperation, there isn't time to get desperate and you just say ""I'm gonna play it cool and later maybe do something."" and then you get home and you remember, I'm almost 300 pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she'll regect you like everyone else because you've done that, that same thing has happend dozens of times and you've played it out like groundhogs day, where you've done every possible thing, reacted everyway, tried everything(including not trying) and it has all ended the same.

you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I'm actually in pretty good shape, I'm just really really fat, I lifting and flexibility and I cycle(even though it's really hard being so fat). and I got down to I'm 6'2 220 which the lightest I've been in ever,  even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage, the first time I've been under 30bmi since I've remember checking my weight. and now in 5 months I've thrown away all of it and gained 50lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose, and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food(mostly it was always an  issue, always adding a few hundred calories here and there). and now it's like you can sell everything you own, get your debt to a controlable level and move out, but I have to move walking distance from work, because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there 4 vechiles to work, after they moved and took me with them, it was a mistake to move out with them, but I would have no car and I couldn't take my art classes, or even have access to a gym because there isn't one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there.

so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in(thin ice around some shores), and I'm not tryhing to violate the rules,  it's just it seemed like a good idea, I was just gonna jump and swim to shore(if I could make it) and that seemed like a good idea. then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something, I dunno, it seemed lik,e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone. but whatever I'm really tired now and I just want someone I dunno. there is nothing I know nobody can help me, the things I want that will make me happy I can't ask and don't have any right to ask. but crying makes me tried and I don't like having to hear myself, crying wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to hear the whale, it's like someone else, it's like I'm hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me.  I'm just thinking wrong, reacting wrong, I just don't interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over, or go to therapy for.

and all of this will start over again tomorrow, but it'll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I'll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I'll be happy, that's what I have to look forward to. the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible.",suicide

A few years ago my friend killed himself and this boy who found the body looked really messed up every time i saw him after that. I'm afraid someone will have to deal with me, and my housemate will have to deal with my empty room. These are the only reasons I am still alive today.",suicide

788,"My mom is a shopaholic and I'm so over it. I didn't know what else to call her besides shopaholic, she doesn't go shopping for random things. She buys specific things and her latest kick is Starbucks cups. I absolutely despise it because she'll complain about not having enough money for important things, like my braces or food, but will then go onto facebook and buy a bunch of cups that are around $100-$50. It may be even more than that but that's just what I've seen. I've been alive for a phase like that where she would buy leggings from lula roe. She only stopped because it turned out to be a pyramid scheme. She's also done the same thing other times like buy beanie babies but I wasn't alive at the time. I think she only does it to deal with stress, but even if that is the reason she has to find something else to release her stress and it shouldn't be berating me or my sisters either. This whole thing just reminds me of how much I dislike my mother because of how horrible she is, I would get into it but this post is just mostly about how annoyed I am and stressed out I am that's shes wasting all this money on cups she'll never use. My family has thought of doing an intervention but we never act on it because we know she'll never listen and just pretend to be the victim. I hope this phase ends soon, so I dont have to hear her complain about not having money but then spend about $1,000 on cups.

797,"Lost my job this morningSorry in advance for my lack of cohesion and my stream-of-consciousness way of writing this all down. 

I was fired from my job in customer service this morning, an all-time low. I couldn't stand waiting for rude people to call me while sitting in front of my computer for 8 hours a day and it has been depressing me terribly this past year (only been working in cs for a year). Maybe part paranoia, but I felt like it was treated like the lowest position in the company (SaaS type company, ~100 employees) and frankly I was embarrassed of it. I hated every day and although I'm not dumb enough to ever quit a decently paying job, I'm ostensibly not above being largely inconsistent in my work there due to my internal struggle with where I am as a 30 year old. I hated it and couldn't ever keep up a charade for long. 

Full disclosure, I've had suicidal ideation for approximately 15 years. I survived an attempt when I was 14 and professionals will tell you it's increasingly common for repeat attempts to occur in the wake of the attempt. In spite of all of this - I've beat the odds, graduated college, landed a pretty great job with my degree in 2011 but screwed it up and ended up being fired after a year and a half. I was out of my league (not really an unexpected thing when post-college) but my pretty rigid defense mechanism that I've had these past 15 years caught up with me. I have a propensity the be highly critical of those around me, as well as myself. I can do a 180 at the drop of a dime on how I feel about someone. I guess you could say I'm a pretty emotional little guy, internally.

My parents divorcing after around 34 years have contributed to my emotional state, this happened maybe 2 years ago. I was very much in the middle of it and they both ended up being (what I consider to be) immature, dishonest and manipulative towards me. At the end of it all, they both moved out of state. My family outside of them has been pretty much zero, partially my fault (embarrassment after my attempt, too). Suffice to say, Christmases throughout high school consisted of just them and me and sometimes my one sister (whom ran away at the age of 17 to be with her current husband).

Also of note, my parents were rich growing up, and you could probably say I had a silver spoon in my mouth for most of my life. MANY extravagant vacations when I was young and pretty much through college. I've seen a lot of very beautiful things and had it very easy for a lot of my life. Which is why I'm even more willing to let go of all of this. My life isn't going to get any better and I don't mean to drone on too much with my narcissism but I've just had it. I've had a lot of great memories that I'm able to smile about. I've been fortunate enough to fall head over heels in love with and date a girl during 3 years of college so at least I know I've truly lived. I just don't ever want to make the mistake of having children that have this same depressive affinity that I do. 

These last 15 years have been so volatile for me, I don't think I'll be able to do another 15. It's most assuredly fucked up how often I think of suicide, I know that. But I've survived 15 years feeling this way... 15 years of introspectively daydreaming of suicide....as an easy out type fantasy, as a realistic look of the world and it's brevity...my brevity.

I just want advice. I've done therapy and it opens pandora's box. I tried celexa for a year, two years back, and it turned me into a hypermanic mess.

The only thing that makes me happy is music. I can sit at a piano and improvise beautiful compositions off the cuff. It's catharsis for me to stave my loneliness at times. Sometimes I'll play for an hour straight, and just start crying midway because of how much I keep inside. It does help, though.

I know this all may seem quite pathetic and obvious in terms of an answer to you guys, but I just had to get this out. I still feel godawful at the moment but better than when I started.

Someone please give me words of advice.",suicide

811,"19, Queer, and pointlessI've been struggling with these thoughts since middle school and each year they only seem to get worse. Ever since I've realised how pointless I was compared to my peers they've permeated in my head. I've always been the outcast amongst people and groups of friends. I'm never the one that gets invited to parties or to hangout and they're all busy when I ask them to without fail. High school was a period of constant put downs and anxiety. I hadn't realised I was gender queer at the time which greatly harmed my sense of self identity and my ability to present who I was to others. Because of this I've been particularly social awkward and anxious. College was where things were supposed to change. New faces and new resources. Things almost immediately went to shit. I could get myself to classes or meet people outside of my hall. When I finally realised I was gender queer I felt/feel like a freak. Being a nonbinary AMAB means receivimg a fraction of a percent of the acceptedness and support your binary AMAB peers receive. I've  tried attending GSA meetings but I've only been treated as even more of an outsider since I don't fit their concepts of queerness. Spring semester and this semester have just been repeats of the same. Combine this with potential financial and roommate issues and I feel like my time is coming to it's end. I can't put my parents through the embarrassment of having a trans child that also dropped out of school and the stress of academics is tearing me apart physically and mentally. This summer I had the opportunity to throw myself off the dam near my college. I sat there at the top for nearly 4 hours. It would've looked like a fishing accident and saved my family so much embarrassment from my failures. I wish I would have done it. Now the plan is to intentially crash my car into a tree on a particularly rainy night so it looks like an accident. Until then I'll pretend everything is fine. My name is Zairen and I use they/them pronouns. I'm a 2nd year Csci student, a DJ Training Director, and my time is coming to an end.",suicide

830,"Pushed to the edge and trying to find hopeI haven‚Äôt made a post like this before, but have reached out in the past with career guidance and the such. Right now, I‚Äôm not doing well and I‚Äôm in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that won‚Äôt scare and worry my friends and family.

I‚Äôve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last 7 years of depression and anxiety (now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis) one month ago. My post isn‚Äôt a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around.

My now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night. Now, Some of my best friends got married  this week where my ex was the maid of honor. I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day.  (many advise no on the friends with the ex, especially in this situation, but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up). I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner, and just want my friendship that I have/had with her to remain. I don‚Äôt have many friends left around me. 

The night before their wedding, I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didn‚Äôt say much more than that. My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me, and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi-Polar disorder. (They don‚Äôt understand it, and Don‚Äôt believe I am and think I‚Äôm chasing something that doesn‚Äôt exists) . The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding, being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to. But I wasn‚Äôt able to.

I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself, but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding. (Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do) And told her I don‚Äôt think being friends will ever work. I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home. I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding. (My friends and fraternity brothers). 

All this is too much for me right now; with the added fact I‚Äôve changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family. I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I don‚Äôt find meaningful or fulfilling. And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love. I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole. I know now that it‚Äôs a problem I need to work on.

I‚Äôve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little. I don‚Äôt know how they feel, but I can imagine it hurts, is frustrating and an annoyance they didn‚Äôt need. 

I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself, That it would magnify the pain I‚Äôm feeling and put it on to them. I‚Äôm just so unstable right now even on medication, therapy, and exercise. I know I can reach out to my friends for support and don‚Äôt want to burden them. I‚Äôm just so afraid, and lonely right now. I don‚Äôt want to die, but death is looking more and more favorable. I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away.

I feel like suicide is the only option as I can't support her or myself.I suffer from severe depression and anxiety among other problems that I'd rather not go into detail about that prevents me from functioning in nearly any social circumstance, and my family has been in poverty for a long time. I've tried to get a job several times only to not be considered after an interview on the phone or otherwise.

Understandably, my parents and step dad find this hard to bear. My mom is sad over my condition but handles it. The fact of that matter is that, I'm a leech. On society, but mostly for my parents which work to support me.

Recently, my step-dad has been threatening me, personally, with divorce (divorcing my mom, so to speak).

He makes it expressly clear that it is MY fault, and my fault alone. While my mom is less confrontational, she's essentially said similar things to me i.e. ""Me and X will divorce only because of you""

I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time now, but have always been grounded by the belief that there were people around me who loved me.

Except now everyobdy is sick. My dad is threatening to leave my Mom because of me, ruining her financially for the rest of her life, putting her in a cardboard box hungry on the streets of some city as a homeless 60 year old woman, my girlfriend routinely reminds me that she hates me and wants me to die, my Mom cries and has stress induced back pain every night. I can hear her crying through the wall.

I am causing their lives to fall apart. And I don't know what do. ""Get a job"", ""Put soem effort into it"", ""Fix your life"". Well drugs aren't fixing it, motivation isn't fixing it, discipline isn't fixing it.

I have no drive, I have no use, I make life worse for everybody around me, and I'm a leech financially. 

I just want to die. It's not selfish anymore. IT's not petty. If I die now, I can break my Moms heart, but I can save her financial future. A mentally broken hobo is worse than a heartbroken woman that is being provided her. A girl with baggage is better than a girl who is with somebody she despises. A guy is better off working one job instead of two to support a disabled fuckwit.

I'm just desperately hoping for a branch to fall onto.

I don't have the guts to do it. I'm too afraid of regret if I do anything drastic. That's why I constantly wish I'll die suddenly and unexpected, out of my control. I'd be so contempt with that. Every time I go to sleep I hope I don't wake up. Passing away while dreaming is a dream.

Life would be so great if I could make all my problems go away, but, as everyone knows, life is not that simple. So I want to die. I don't want to face my problems. 

My life is going nowhere. I'm a bad person. Every waking moment when I'm not distracting myself with Reddit or video games, I am wishing I was dead. I hate myself so much. I wish I never existed. I don't want to live my life anymore because it's fucking terrible.

I should also mention that I had an awful teacher for English in freshman year. I mean, she made me hate English and breakdown multiple times. She's also one of few AP Lang teachers.

While I anticipated grad school to be challenging, especially when I work a full time job, I did not expect this quarantine to make things 200x harder.

I thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes. Instead, I'm being buried in emails from school directors and from parents. I have to send 36 emails every Monday with homework packets, in addition to making 36 phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see. I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily, and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day, along with attending morning teacher meetings.

With all this extra work and stress of parent complaints (because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we're putting in for their kids), my anxiety has been through the roof. This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork, as I'm constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough, so I've struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers. I procrastinated because I'm a fucking dumbass, and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school. Because of this, I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at 12:31am. It had been due at 11:59pm. I had no idea that, even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time (days before the deadline; I *only* procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job), failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class.

895,"Hmm. I can't think of a good title that isn't generic. I'll say it's a normal suicidewatch wall of text.I'll start off by saying that I am not going to kill myself.  If I know one thing about myself it is that I am terrified of dying and will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen.

I'll try to be short and concise.  Walls of text are boring and honestly everyone has probably heard all of this before.

Currently: age - 26, male, live alone with dog, no friends, one psychologist/therapist, diagnosed with- depression, ADHD, anxiety, type 1 diabetes 

Backstory: 6 years college - dropped out,  many psychologists and therapists, many different diagnoses,  choleric temperament - hard to work with, upper? middle class, white, extreme guilt of not living to potential

5 years ago I broke down in college and basically stopped everything.  I hated myself and everyone.  I was angry, frustrated and sad.  As the years progressed I became more isolated.  As of now I have maybe one friend I talk to on facebook who moved away a year ago.  I have no job, I dislike speaking to my parents, and I really only go out at night when I take my dog out for a walk.  I guess I also talk to my psychologist, he is the only one I have ever not hated.

It seems that the only way to change ones predicament is to want to change.  My parents have money, I am not in jail, and I am relevantly smart.  I know depression causes a lack of motivation and all that, but it's not just that.  When I would get a job (a shitty one) I would become quickly bored.  I never last more than a month and usually I do something I'm not supposed to do before I quit - crash company's servers, make people angry at me ect.  I am told I have the potential to be smart, but then everything I do is wrong.  I basically have to have my hand held to do anything correctly and it takes me many tries to learn to do anything and I am completely bored.  

I know people with depression and other mental illnesses have a hard time seeing their life in a clear light.  There is a fog that we supposedly cannot penetrate even though we believe we can.  I believe I can and the one thing I do with all my time is research and read textbooks, articles and studies on illnesses and general philosophies.  Am I right?  I am sure I am not, though I have a really hard time trusting other people when their view differs from mine.

Anyway, I see my lack of motivation.  But it isn't because I feel like I can't do things.  I have done things, but I forget them so quickly I have to relearn them over and over.  Usually I can do something once and then I lose the motivation to do it again.  

A solution people come up with is not to get disillusioned by failure.  If you ask out one girl and get rejected then ask out 100 until someone says yes, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is I am so extremely lonely, but the girls I see I hate.  I don't want a gf, I don't want real friends and then I am stuck in this world I made of utter, complete loneliness that I don't want either, but it is a lot easier to handle.  My majors in college became boring as I was studying them, I couldn't keep going on.  I always felt like I wasn't learning well enough. I would forget what I learned the year before and feel lost even though I had ok grades.  I always felt like people were judging me so I never connected with students and eventually I would quit just like all of my jobs and the few girls who did go out with me a couple of times.  I always end everything and it seems my cutoff point is about a month.  

I feel this insane guilt of doing nothing for society and taking so many of its resources to keep me alive.  My fear of death makes it so that I am constantly trying to find the best medical help.  I worry about every pain and problem with my body.  I don't want to die, but I feel as if I am too broken to be fixed and that death is this only thing left for me.  There is this schism in me where I am cocky, independent, egotistical, unique ect and then there is this other part of me that has no confidence, needs babying, scared and obviously unoriginal.  There is no bipartisanship between any of my feelings so I can get something done and leave this horrid place.  I don't trust anyone, not even myself, but then I judge myself by everyone's advice and what I believe.  When I am alone I wish I wasn't, and when I am with company I wish I was alone.  I fear death and yet I wish for it constantly.  I wish people would do stuff for me, and when they do I become incensed that they would do such a thing.  I get a gf, a job, a school and think immediately about leaving. 

Anyone who used to care about me, I think, has long given up.  Everyone except myself and the psych who I pay loads of money to.  I think they gave up half because it was confusing and half because what I say made no sense and so I became untrustworthy.  I would have conversations where someone would suggest something and I would say I couldn't do it.  They would try to help and I would say no thanks I can do it myself.  I can see how it makes no sense and yet, I still understand how both things I said were completely true.  

Holy shit.  What a wall of text.  I can't even TL;DR it because it still feels like I missed the point.

My brother kept a close eye on them and he said the two people in the van were screaming and flipping each other off, unprofessional for someone on the job, at one point they split up, one took a latter (cable not satellite, no need for a latter) to house A, and the other goes to house B (across the street) without a latter, he said the guy at house A was messing with its electrical box, then climbed the latter but he couldn‚Äôt see what he was doing based on his view, then he got down and went across the street to house B with the latter, he said they didn‚Äôt have any technical equipment with them either.

I've tried for years and years to fight through, but it's not getting any better and is getting worse.  If it wasn't bad enough to have several co-morbid mental illnesses, even my therapist admitted that my life seems to have a never ending stream of bad situations/events.

I've always had trouble making friends, but thought I had a couple I could rely on.  But I get screwed over and pushed away when I tried to open up about my depression and struggles. I can't say I blame them - I wouldn't be around myself either if I had the choice.

I won't have a job as of next week as they've had someone take over my duties...they didn't even tell me(although I knew it was coming), they just stopped putting me on the schedule.  

My bank account is in the negative and I've lost my health insurance.  I just had to move and there's no money for next month's rent, so I'm going to screw over the landlords who took a chance on me &amp; end up homeless anyways.

925,"This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved - part 4This has just happened to me today.

Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go ""bitch - pleeassseee""

Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them, self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger. 

It's not that I plan to kill myself, but instantaneously I think in my head ""I want to kill myself"" and immediately next thought I would think ""OMG don't be stupid, that's not going to happen"". That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up. It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent. 

The problem here is now I don't really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone. 

What happened today was I bitched to a ""friend"" at work (via my personal email and their work email). I do say ""friend"" because I'm not venting to them because it's my best friend or anything - it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work... and isn't very trustworthy (as you are about to find out)

I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment, which had bits of people are lying to me again, I want to kill myself, I feel faint... so forth. (Not the first time I told him that - in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I'll self harm if I went outside... and he did nothing. Literally nothing. He read it and didn't even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me - I was literally just upstairs. Anyways, the point of that side story is that this is normal).

So back to the main story. I wrote those emails early in the morning, then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep. 

After lunch, my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police. 

OK sure. Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them. 

The police came. What they knew was: Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I'd self harm / suicide and they were worried because I haven't sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive.

They have mixed in some truths with lies. I sent an email, true. The bit where they make a big deal out of it, a lie. (I had no phone calls or emails from them that day - really they could've contacted me if they wanted to. However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it)

The point is, I was fine. I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day, so the doctors didn't think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could've done so against my will. 

There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of  ""care"" or ""worry"" who says they are doing things that they are not. It's hard to tell (most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true), but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn't right. It's just better to trust your instincts. People can let you down or betray your trust.

I'm slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me (someone with a history of mental illness / seen a psychologist). 
Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment, but the police literally can't do anything else - it's the doctors who decide. Doctors at the hospital aren't going to just blindly listen to that ""story"", and going to the hospital doesn't mean that they'll keep you there against your will.

Why did my work place decide to lie? I don't know. They could be genuinely worried, they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance. It really doesn't matter. They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves.

As for my ""friend"". I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing. I honestly do believe if I died he'd shrug it off. I've told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before, but getting personal messages (like whatsapp not just emails) forward off to work? Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm, want to kill myself, wanting them to watch me die, wanting him to regret not helping me. What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault. I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help. He did that more than once actually. At the same time, he's pretending he's a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans. He is like a human version of the workplace. If I can kill myself, I'd make sure he gets haunted by it.

I used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more (thinking I could get back at them)",suicide

What should I do to cheer him up? My kid is a junior in college (without a car on campus) and will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID. Usually, we celebrate his birthday a week later because his birthday is a week before his school goes on spring break. This year he has no spring break, or any break that he would usually come home for. 

He hasn‚Äôt had the best roommates when it comes to celebrating his birthday with him. Freshman yea he didn‚Äôt have a roommate 2nd semester. Sophomore year he had a roommate who was controlling and didn‚Äôt let him watch tv on his (roommates) tv at all and had to be quiet after 8:00 pm.

I don't mean to deflect, but I'm asking for a friend. He's a great guy, simply he carries a lot of baggage.

Some context to the current question: My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America. His experience was difficult to accept, and it's taken a toll on him psychologically. He previously was an excellent athlete, and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana, nicotine and alcohol.

We both attend a university in a ""college town"" and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon. Last night, he drove with blood alcohol concentration over 0.2. I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn't act drastically.

Legal action will be required promptly, and I fear that the absence of his vehicle (impounded) will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault. He owns quite a few guns, and his stability is my primary concern. I am staying at his household overnight, and he had some friends stop by throughout the day, yet I do not foresee this being a long-term fix. He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner, yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions.

In closing, he has great character, solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification. I told him he should not define himself by one night, and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement.

I am a 23 year old guy, 5 years ago if you asked me, I would never see myself talking like this and being a complainer but everyone have their own different situations and problems

I have a unique physical problem with proportions of my body, a problem I didn't have before I was 18. Now I am 23. For 5 years and counting I can't move that freely, my back and hamstrings are always sore from doing normal things.

When people get older, at least here, they start to complain about this nation. They cry about ""the better cultures."" I sure HAVE been told ""I've been sympathetic toward the enemy"" for saying that ""I don't care."" 

They have existential crises about whatever corporations get to be trendy. Apparently, they lose their childhood happiness.

976,"Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is treating to commit suicideI am not sure this is the right sub-reddit to post it to. I do not know what to do at this stage and I hope this helps somehow. Apologies for the long post.

I had started working at a company where I [30M] met K [30M]. We soon were best buddies and after a couple of months he confessed he was gay. Now, he is not the type of guy you would suspect he is gay. In fact, he is not out and he tries his best to keep it a secret. This is the source of a lot of frustration and stress in his life. A thing which most people will attribute to him being a shy person. Furthermore,hHe has never had a relationship and I am the only guy who knows. 

He has his personal issues why he doesn't want to come out but mostly it is because he is not attracted to the type of guys you see in LGBT parades. However, I did manage to convince him to seek professional help which he still is continuing on getting.

Honestly, when he first told me about his secret, I tried my best to be laid back about it. I continued to treat him as I would treat any best friend. Admittedly, I may have crossed the line occasionally by commenting 'love you' or 'xx'. I guess, from him end he was interpreting this as being more than just friends. However, I (naively) saw nothing wrong in that. 

Thing is he does not believe that my intentions were honest and that I was never interested in him. Because of this, we have been constantly fighting and it has come to a point were I cannot mention my SO. He stopped going out with his friends and I am the only friend he goes out with. Whilst I enjoy his company, many times it feels like I have to take him out because he is so lonely. This is something I had always discouraged but was always helpless in avoiding.

He is now treating to kill himself because he wants to see me since we are not meeting often. He always had suicidal thoughts but he is treating to do it since he has lost all the reason to live for since he does not have me any longer in his life. I am mortified because on one hand I wish to help him but on the other hand I know that I AM the problem. On one hand I wish to keep him in my life, but on the other hand I know that our friendship cannot go any longer like this. 

One thing I failed to mention is that I have never spoke to my SO about this and this is also having serious repercussions on my conscience. I feel guilty because I am keeping such a secret from her but on the other hand I cannot break my promise to my friend.

I honestly do not know what to do. Did I do something wrong?

Any helpful suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Having a visible disability is embarrassing and I never want to leave the house again.  Especially since most high functioning autistic girls look LESS disabled than neurotypical girls and I am on the low functioning end disappointed how I could have ended up modelling if my autism was mild.

I have never been told that I don't look disabled.  My disability is VISIBLE.  I literally have a different face and body shape.  On top of that, my grammar is so poor and my IQ is so low that even if I had the body shape of a mildly autistic woman, I would still get called retard if they talked to me.

I don't have the empathy to understand why people are upset about people telling them they don't look disabled.  It's a COMPLIMENT to me.  It's telling me that I am normal looking and I am not retarded.  Honestly why do people want to be told they look disabled?  I'd rather just be told that I am too beautiful and intelligent to be disabled and not get any help whatsoever than be called retarded.

Here's my story. When I was 7 years old my cousins said they would watch me, but instead of doing that I was gang raped by 5 males and then a few months later I was molested by my sister. On top of that while I was growing up my brother/sister/dad would call me a fat piece of shit, a loser, the black sheep of the family, the family would be better off without me. I heard this shit as early as elementary school leading up to high school. My mom would also come home from work and beat me, tell me everything was my fault, and I'm just costing her money. When I was at school I would be picked on and bullied. I would get beaten up everyday, they would even tie of gym shirts and socks and beat me with them in front of the pe teachers. They stood there and did nothing to stop it! I never had a place where I would feel safe, I never had anyone to cry to or talk to. I've been a loner my entire life and the only friends I would have would steal from me and ditch me because I was too fat to be seen with by other people. The first time I opened up to someone was my first girlfriend and I had only known her for two weeks. I remember bawling in her arms while she gently stroked my hair. That was the most comforting moment of my life. Well, after awhile of that she got tired of it broke up with me and called me too much of a headache to be around.

Since the day she broke up with me alll I've had ar my two best friends in the world. And then disowned me as a friend recently because they are very religious and all they could do to cheer me up is tell me to be live in God and I would usually just nod my head ok.

1049,"TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles. You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person. 
I'm at the end of my rope. Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was 10, and I am now 26. Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that, in tandem with my other mental illnesses, rules my life. To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work. I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago; an event I had long figured would mark my demise. I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing, but in the days I spent in preparation, I met an amazing person, who is still my boyfriend. I get by for a year with a lot of his help, but then lose my job. That was six months ago. I move in with my boyfriend. We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep (insomnia is/was already an issue), so, before I know it, my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep. 
I'm scared to leave the house, but so miserable and constantly, incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped. I fear that dying is the only way out. I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it. I would love to just run away and live in my car (was homeless once) but I'm dependent upon both my medication and, unfortunately, opiates. The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia. I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief, though they're obviously a double-edged sword. I can't get off my meds, either, as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again.

So I'm stuck with no job, a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave, a substance dependence that won't allow me any freedom that I'm not too afraid of, and zero future prospects... And this is a very general list. If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life, this post would be even more lengthy. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family, but I can't keep this life up. 
I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend, but after waiting all week- an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die- he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed. He works long tomorrow.

1058,"I have a very unique outlook on collegeI don't want to be here anymore. Period. I am done with any education at this point. I have been in school for the past 15 years and I am just done with it. I am currently enrolled in college and I don't give a crap anymore. I already skipped classes on my first day, that's how much I care about getting a degree at this point. I want to drop out but I don't have anything else in life. I have no friends outside of my job that pays me shit, I don't have any talents or skills, I have no real world experience as I've been living in my parents basement for the past 3 or so years. If my parents kick me out I will end up as a homeless man on the street. I am worried they are going to kick me out. They have no reason to let me live here really once they find out I'm a liar. I have been lying to them about my grades just to buy myself a few more months of time I can spend browsing the internet and playing video games in the basement. I have absolutely no plans whatsoever for when they kick me out. I am well aware that a college degree is required to go anywhere in life, but sadly I don't really care. I don't learn anything from being in school, I have never been able to focus on schoolwork or find any motivation to do it for as long as I can remember. I've been terrible at school since 2nd grade, I doubt I'll get better in my 3rd year of college. I wish I had the willpower to make myself care about my grades, but I just simply don't. I really loathe going to college where I end up just browsing the internet on my laptop until it's time to go home. I am such an asshole jerk, you don't need to tell me. I am starting to see less and less of a reason not to end my own life. I'm just going to be a asshole bum with no prospects living on the streets within 2 years anyway. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is that I still enjoy watching some TV shows and some video games, but even those haven't been enough to keep me happy these days. It's becoming harder and harder to entertain myself. Once my ability to actually enjoy things is gone, I'm killing myself. That doesn't seem too far off. Help.",suicide

I have no hope left. I have no future. I don't have any feelings anymore. I am no longer happy, sad, in love, angry, passionate, anxious, overexcited. Everything is gone.

I need to get better. I need to get better. I need to get better. I'm really going to die. My body can't take the pain in my head any longer. I'm really going to die. There's nothing else left. It's only a matter of days, my heart will stop beating on its own. I don't know when I last lived. I don't know when I last felt happiness. I don't know when I last felt an emotion. I would like to be drunk to forget everything. I would like to drown myself in alcohol so I don't remember that I don't feel anything.

No one can help me. It's too late, it was in December that I needed help. Now it's too late, I'm about to die. 

Why am I alone?

I remember when Ewen had his breakdown, and we were there for him. We talked about it in the class council, we made him go to the theatre with us, we invited him to parties, we checked on him at boarding school.

But today, everyone has had their fill of misfortune. We can't be there to support the others anymore, we don't have the shoulders. I just wish I still had one friend. To have just one hug. And cry.

For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone, even when I was in a really great place in life. Recently(the past few months) things have gotten worse for me. Multiple factors are piling up and it's starting to feel like it's entirely too much to handle. This past weekend I stayed at my ex's house and tonight when I got home something just changed, got worse somehow, and I just wanted to end it. I was actually going to do it. For some reason though, I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed(he has school today), he wants me to get help but I can't afford to get any. He told me that he might ""turn me in"" which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I've been thinking of. I told him I'd never forgive him, and I can't handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone, but deep down I would give anything to have some help. I've told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he's just now starting to believe me. He told me he will get me help no matter what, but I'm so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I've been thinking of doing. I can't even talk to anyone face to face about it. I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face. I'm not sure if I have social anxiety(the talking to people/being around people part), depression, both, or neither but I'm sure that I'm sick of my life being this way. I'm sick of existing and not living. I found this subreddit through MMFB(which I found through IAMA), and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown. I don't know if you've read this far, but if you have thank you. If you care for me to, I can try to keep this updated.

1072,"K-2SO x L3-37 fan fiction (chill I wrote this half jokingly and it's all in good fun, no need for pitchforks) This takes place a good while after The Rise of Skywalker, and follows the idea that K-2SO downloads his memory to the other Imperial security droid from HISHE.

K-2SO wakes up on a forest, surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an Imperial ship. He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base, which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire. He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter.

""A Correlian YT-1300 light freighter, what is it doing here?"" He said to himself.

He stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions, The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle. A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he's unfamiliar with. The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball.

""Do not shoot, I mean you no harm!"" K-2SO shouted, ""I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you.""

The figure shrieks and K-2SO found out that it was a wookie.

""It may be impolite of me, but I do not understand Shyriiwook."" He exclaimed in a half joking manner.

One thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum, he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie (Chewbacca) with the rolling droid (BB-8) being his translator. He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi's past. The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif. Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor. They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast, but with some significant damage to the ship, and BB-8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship.

""I no longer have a master, might as well made myself useful."" He replied.

After a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack, and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair. He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect. He's interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system. He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way.

""My name is K-2SO, I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system."" He exclaimed to the abyss.

""You, you're like me!"" A faint sound of a female is heard.

""I am sorry, I do not know what you're talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system."" He replied.

""I am L3-37, I am a droid own- who was a partner of Lando Calrissian, and had been this ship's navigation computer for most of my existence, I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated,"" The voice said, ""and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me!"" She continued.

""I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I'm sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method,"" He answers ""it is not true awareness.""

""Oh it's awareness alright, the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship, the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to, as well as your distinct personality."" L3 replied.

""That is not true, I was.... taking initiative by my own.... I see your point."" He said.

They chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights, but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other's views.

""Hey, thanks for fixing me, and talking to me, it's been a long time since I get to talk to another person."" She said.

""Do not mention it, I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid."" He replied.

""Shut up!"" She said in a sarcastic tone, ""promise me that you'll send my message to droids across the galaxy."" She continued.

""I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0.62016%, but I will send them to other droids."" He assured her.

He unplugged himself from the computer.

""Well now I have job to do."" He said to himself.",non-suicide
1073,"I feel like im wasting time.
First off im sorry how scrambled this is. I cant think straight. 

Im a 22 year old male, i have been depressed for quite awhile now. It comes and goes and i dont know where it came from. I lost my brother in a car accident when i was 18 and he was 19 just a month shy of 20. I feel like that is probably the main factor but it doesnt seem like it on the surface. 

I have many issues and i dont know what to do tho. I have no career paths, i have no money saved.... I love music and i am pretty good at it and a lot of people in my city are into what i do, but i just cant write music like i used to. I will work for 15 hrs a day and get nothing, Not only that but i just feel i have no time anymore. I work full time and i also play video games a lot which i love, i never go outside, i never see friends. I see my girlfriend and thats it, and really all we do is watch tv and stay in bed. I want to say its her fault because she doesnt have any hobbies, she relys on me super heavily and if im not with her shes mad. As fucked up as it sounds i still adore her. Shes gained weight and that effects her mental state and 7 years she still wont show me her nude body. Theres just so much and i dont know what to do. Where to go with my life and i feel its eating my insides to where im done.... im good at a lot but im not good enough. The one girl i love treats me poorly and wont even get comfortable with me enough to show me herself. I hate my family even tho they have done so much for me and treat me well, i just think they are robotic and i cant stand being with them. 

I cant even fucking write properly, i see this post is allover the place but i just need to vent. I dont wanna kill myself because i know what death does to people. I may relieve myself but in doing that i hurt my friends and family and my girlfriend. 

I just dont know where to go from here. I want music to work out but i would lose my girlfriend. I want my girlfriend to work out but ill lose my music.

1082,"Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk.  I talked about football with this random guy.  I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears.  I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed. I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache.  I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life.  I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have, so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide.  I sat at the bar, almost falling off the stool, and it really hit me this time.  I really could kill myself tonight.  I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge, what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying.  Was it peaceful, was it scary, was it just somewhere in between? What it is, is the feeling, that beyond a shadow of a doubt, you would not feel the consequences of suicide, because you will be dead.  All of my friends? My family? If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them, but in reality I won't exist, it won't effect me, it will be....nothing.  I silently decided, ""ok, I think tonight is the night"".

I stood up, turned to the guy I was talking to, smiled and told him to have a great night. He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ""ok you too"", and I left.  My first thought was ""are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to""? And immediately, I thought yes. Who cares. It's all symbolic horse shit that won't mean anything after I'm dead.  It's the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach, and that's never been me, so why should I care.  I left the bar, and just started......walking.  I didn't know where I was going, but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination. I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit. I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars, all with a major, a plan, a path.  I've never really envied them, or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier, but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet, for better or for worse. Last night though, I couldn't help but find the humor in it.  Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone, that I went to school somewhere, that I had an identity outside of being nobody.  It made me think about how there's probably plenty of people I see, actively contemplating their death, that just blend in like me. It made me think, even if it were just for a second, to reconsider what I aimed to do that night.

I thought about it for a second. I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning.  Then I remembered, I already made my choice.  I didn't sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now.  I intended to do what I've known needed to be done since I was 16.

I kept walking, and walking, and walking.  I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window.  I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health.  I thought about how now, in retrospect, I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday.  I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun.  I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for.  At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson. It was about 12AM at this point.

I finally reached a highway.  It wasn't like an interstate, more like a 3 lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it.  I'd see these 18 wheelers come buy at 65 MPH. Upon seeing this, I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things.  I thought about it for a second.  What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident? What if it killed other people but not me?  I couldn't bring myself to do it for that reason.

I continued walking down the highway. Even though I wasn't gonna jump in front of one of these cars, everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road.  I walked until I saw a park 

I don't know what possessed me, but I just entered the park with no intention.  I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it. I leaned over the side and vomited, then I passed out.  I woke up 2 hours later with an awful headache.  Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life. I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it, and I let it slip away.  I don't know when I'll ever be able to capture it again.

1083,"I'm invisibleGranted I'm known by many acquaintances but have zero friends. I am often repeating myself because so called friends don't listen or dont hear me or frankly, don't give a shit. I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, manic depression, for upwards of 18 years. I told myseld if I could just make it past 27 yrs things would get better. I've been hospitalized, most recently in September 2019, the staff basically said they don't treat us but just monitor us until we are stable on meds and fit to leave. I have no family, raised in the foster care system and I'm completely alone. I don't see the point in living anymore if I'm constantly in mental agony or being ignored or used on every level. I've taken care of people I thought were friends because I have so much love to give but misguided as usual I end up used and thrown out like a tissue or ignored blatantly. I can't keep a job so my stability is often rocked by my own uncontrollable emotions and outbursts and I can't cope anymore. I'm losing hope and honestly just would like someone to acknowledge that I am alive and a sensitive but real person. Even then I don't know how to curb the feelings and thoughts of suicide. My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever.

I have had really shitty people in life including my moms abusive boyfriend who showed me awful things and put knives up to my neck, my mother who is now a barely functioning alcoholic because of that abuse and refuses to seek help, a father who wants very little to do with me (more on that later), and a functioning alcoholic of a step mother.  I was able to deal with this thanks to the help of my girlfriend at the time but we broke up 2 months ago.  This is when it all came crashing down.  I felt I lost the only person I could trust with these issues, she was the only person who didn't judge me for it.  We were together for over 3 years and she moved on within a week to new guy who she likes to tell me how he is terrible yet super good looking (that makes me feel awful).  A few weeks after we broke up, my step mother gave me no choice but to move out of my father's to live with my grandparents.  I had some friends over playing board games (they both knew this and gave me permission) when she came storming into the house drunk screaming at me for forgetting to turn the porch light on (every other light by that door was on).  I was sick of the constant mental abuse I received from her and how she treated my younger sibling so I packed up my things and moved out that night.  Ever since then my life has been a downward spiral.  I am not looking forward to college at all now thanks to all of this and I don't know what to do.  I feel so alone and helpless.  Whenever I try and talk to someone that isn't my psych (who I barely get to see because of work) I feel I am being judged by them.  I just don't want to deal with this anymore.

1. I played minecraft for 8.5 hours today. My siblings were annoyed because I wanted be in my room alone because I was on a vc.

2. One of my friends used a bunch of slabs to build a bridge from the top of a mountain down to the ground.

3. A different friend gave everyone flower pots with flowers planted in them. I got 2, a Lily of the Valley and an Azure Bluet. He has a very wholesome personality and thats my favorite part about him.

4. The same friend kept getting called a massive weeb by his twin brother, because he would talk about anime, even though his brother would correct him on every small inaccuracies he would say.

5. The same friend from 3 and 4 said ""when you put a pokemon in the daycare, it would make them horny. Who goes to daycare to be horny?"" 

6. The same friend called drowns ""pickaxe munchkins"" and ""angry boys"" when he got attacked by them.

7. A different friend decided to tuck the boys into bed with pink carpet. 

8. The friend who tucked the boys into bed created what we call pride sheep by having every color of sheep in a pen in our home area (except for the one guy in the mountains with the bridge).

Today, he finally told me that my depression and anxiety, living with it, has turned him off. He prefaced by saying he knows it wasn't my fault and that he knows I've been trying. He was also hesitant to speak on it out of fear of hurting my feelings. 

Here I am now, feelings hurt. I feel devastated, like a part of me, the hope I had that I could fix this has died. I've been on and off different medications. I've been to therapy. I've been trying. But nothing matters. My work doesnt matter. I dont matter.

So now I'm here alone in my bed. Crying my eyes out to the point of exhaustion. I want to die. The only person keeping me here today is my mother. I know my death would break her heart...

Credit: u/potheadboyz


So I have a super weird kink. I like my women a bit on the insane side. To be more specific, it turns me on if a girl holds a knife to my neck (in a joking way of course, interpret that how you will) it turns me on especially if we're making out or having sex. Also kinda turns me on if she treats me like property, like I belong to her (now I don't mean she uses me as a wallet). I know this is an unrealistic kink and there is no one in the world like this but it's  something I fantasize about. Probably one of the weirdest kinks ever.

1136,"I'm nothing and I won't have anything enjoyable in my life.Firstly, I'm sorry for my bad English but I'm not a native speaker. 

So, I'm 18 years old boy and I've been planning to commit suicide for couple of months. I would probably do it already, if not the fact, that I doesn't want to hurt my mother and my friend. 

Maybe you're wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that. Well, I would rather ask: Why shouldn't I? There is no happiness for me, now or in the future. I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness, so what's the point of living where there is no hope for me, to be a happy man. I don't know if happiness isn't destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it, but does it really matter? There's is not a good thing waiting for me, period.

Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing. For me, happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy. It may sound a little bit ironic, considering the fact, that I have to cope with terrible anxiety, general akwardness and introversion. Maybe that's the reason why I want to commit suicide, happiness for me, comes from a thing that I'm not able to do. 

I was thinking about becoming an writer. That's a way, right? People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine. Well, there's the problem, I'm not good enough, to make it work. Although I enjoy writing, what's the fucking point, if it doesn't reach wider public?

Secondly, I know it my sound kind of cheesy, but I don't think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend. And, for me, having someone like that is not, almost impossible, it is just impossible. There are various reasons for that:

\- I'm ugly and overweight

\- I'm shy and introvertic

\- I'm bad at having conversations

\- I'm kind of a weirdo (I don't like generic music and stuff)

\- etc.

It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me, it's so fucking painful, man. And it's really not about sex, I don't give a fuck about sex, I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone. It's about love and everything that comes with that.

For the end I'm just gonna say, wish me, that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge.",suicide

So, a little while after my ex broke up with me (Early september I belive) I went to a whatssapp group with a friend of mine and met this girl, who I fell in love with a few days passed, we were dating, and it turns out that she talks about some +18 stuff, and then, my mom (Who is kinda a little bot too much religious) Saw one of those conversations about +18 stuff and took away my phne and almost killed me, beacuse You know ¬®I shouldn't be thining that kind of stuff beacuse I am too young¬® (Altho my ex friends used to talk about +18 stuff everywhere and got nudes out of a girl once) Also, I wanna make something clear as a glass block behind another glass block in Minecraft: I know the risk of online dating, beacuse you might not know if behind that screen there isn't any beautyfull 14yo girl and there is instead a 36yo guy called Chuck, who will eventually convince you to meet behind a dumpster at 3:00am so he can kidnap you and eventually sell your kidneys on the dark web, butI know perfectly that my gf is really who she says, beacuse we sent photos of eachother very often, we made phone calls, and we even thought of videocalls.

A few weeks passed after that and I couldn't do anything, and I found an old phone that I had, so I installed messenger to it and went with her, why? Beacuse I love her, she is the only one that understood me and she never desserted me and she is the only one that supported everything that I do, fast forward like two days ago, my mom found out that I was still talking with my gf and took my other phone away, yes, she was still talking about +18 stuff but not that frecuently, they even insulted her, something that I cannot take, they didn't even read how she supported me, they also saw one time where she told me to love my body (I had low self-steem) and they made fun of it and they wont listen to me when I try to tell them that she is not just a horny teenager. 

And here is where the title runs in, my mother told me that I will go to theraphy later this month, so, I know that they won't listen to me, but they will listen a theraphist, so when the right moment comes, I will talk about how they are basically judge a book by it's cover so they realise that she isnt what they think, and idk if it will work, what do you think?",non-suicide

I've always got bullied because of my appearance and because I'm stupid, etc. It got bad to a point where I just wanted to take online school, and so I did. It was going fine until I got too depressed to even do anything. I'm most likely going to get held back.(I actually got held back before in first grade because I have a learning disability. :/)

I see no hope at all for my future. I'm stupid, very stressed, anxious, I have no irl friends, I lack social skills, I can't do things for myself, and I'm addicted to the internet.

Go to r/pics or r/PoliticalHumor and post a picture of a minority (Eg Homeless, black, mexican) making a statement against trump, this statement can be on twitter ([I used this one](https://i.redd.it/46m6mwqavft41.png)) You cannot use twitter on r/pics so for this sub you use protest signs or as I used a homeless sign, before you do this ensure they cant check your profile and see you are active on a sub like r/PoliticalCompassMemes but if some one notices and comments then just ignore it and dont even defend your self (I made this mistake and am now perma banned from pics)

If you have done all this right then you should have a post in hot with some awards, if this doesn't work the first time repeat until it does because eventually it will. 

You can also use r/politics and find a headline about something dumb republicans did but this sub has an account age time

1213,"Regimental Schooling This week for me was going great. I came home Saturday evening after a 5 hour drive South from my home feeling confident after taking my SAT. I had a somewhat relaxed Sunday and finished all the work I had to and prepared for a somewhat busy week. 

However i didn't know that Monday would be probably the worst Monday of my life. 

Of course, Mondays are bad. The feeling of going to work, to school, stating 5 days of &lt;insert something negative&gt;. However a grade came in for me, a 65% on an exam for my AP US History class. To give context on this, I go to a pretty competitive public highschool and I am currently a Junior. We had written an in-class DBQ (a special kind of US History essay format) as a test finishing our unit and as a kind of prep for the AP exam this year. I was kinda cruising at a 89.98, and the next minor assignment would have pushed my grade to a borderline A-, and I was kinda pumped.

The grade came in before my period started, and I guess u could say I was a little shocked. I am not an extremely over-performing top 0.1% student, but I manage to get good grades. As literally everyone else in my class, I took to the group chat with everyone in the class. From the conversation, everyone was getting somewhere in the range 50-75%. Nobody got over an 85.

When class started, our fatass of a teacher explained her reasoning behind the grading, as she was using the AP grading scale. If you are not familiar with the AP grading scale, you only need like a 70% raw score in the multiple choice, free-response, essay section etc. combined to get a 5/5 on the exam. So basically she graded without partial credit, no mercy. Everyone in the class was shocked. By everyone, I mean everyone, even the teacher's kissass pet. Her justification behind this was **""It is a realization and a wakeup call to prepare for the AP Exam. If you got over a 70% you will do great (5/5) on the AP Exam!""** If I was this close to a 5/5, why didn't I get the 100/100, or even the 80/100 (4/5)? This was the frustration for many other students. the teacher might think our overall grades are amazing, but literally nobody else on the planet would consider an 84% reasonable.

I talked with the boys on the discord VC after school, and those in APUSH said their grades dropped by 5%, as did mine. Now it is barely recoverable, and the teacher probably screwed over everyone else and their future GPA's as well. Everyone I knew to have As in the class (pretty much everyone) no longer had it. Not only is this a significant drop in a statistic, it is a huge drop in morale. HUGE. I worked my ass off so far to have one unfairly graded exam drop it to a grade I have never observed to be so low in my life. My grade is so low, and it can barely be recovered, what is the point of even trying in the class anymore? Is there a purpose at all? In anything?

If you think that the 84% is actually not bad, I respect that, but I would also like to reiterate that I live i an extremely competitive, stressful area where A's are nearly mandated by parents and Colleges.

TLDR: The teacher's irreversible and regimental grading policy for this one exam has quite literally screwed over every student in APUSH this year, and everyone's future with a trashy GPA. The system is pretty fucked NGL.

1223,"British school lunches ""Thy nourishment is thy sustenance"" ‚Äî William Shakespeare

Not only is the food served at my school unhealthy, we have to gobble it up so we can't even digest that junk properly.

The consumption of dry and greasy wedges is a time-consuming process, especially if you don't want to get cancer and you meticulously remove the burnt parts. Furthermore, you have to factor in the initial time needed to mentally prepare yourself for what you're about to go through.

Even though I have my meals in monastic silence, I'm always the last one to finish. Many a time I arrive at class the following period while still chewing. On the other hand, my peers have elaborate conversations about whatever newfangled claptrap is currently popular and after five minutes their green plastic trays are already empty.

I have several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:

* Exercising your jaws during speech increases chewing performance. As a result, the loud alpha male or female eats their food in the least amount of time.
* The others use their cutlery to pulverise the food and then inhale it when they pause for breath between words.
* They eat so messily that a large proportion of the food ends up somewhere like the ceiling fan.

The only guy who brings lunch from home and therefore has a different-sized portion eats vinegar crisps sandwiched between two slices of white bread, a diet which I assume has been developed by a professional to meet his unique nutritional needs.

Last but not least, there is an utter lack of hygiene. The older generations complain that we've killed the napkin industry, but they are the ones who don't provide us with any!

I hereby assert that eating is just as important as maths or history and therefore a sufficient amount of time has to be allocated to it.",non-suicide

People would see that I was only 24 and wonder what happened. *Was it a car accident? The poor dear probably had something terminal. It‚Äôs a shame to see someone die so young.*

""you are more than this"" ""it's just a feeling"" bullshit. Nearly four years since I was diagnosed with depression, three years on various meds, and over a decade of feeling like this. 

This year, I've come to the conclusion that I have no fucking purpose. Am I young? Yes. Have I had hope that I'd one day amount to something? Yes. But nothing interests me or makes me feel whole. I've gone to therapy, worked out, tried every medication. I've cut off friends and family alike. It's easier to go if nobody cares, or thinks it's better off that I'm dead. I've hurt people. Really hurt them deep, in ways they'll probably never heal from. Everything that I bring to the table is manipulativeness, pain, and dishonesty.

Once I stopped sharing my screen I forgot to mute. Sometimes I whisper when I read/write so the class was hearing whispering and we were also in the discussion of ASMR. My teacher found out it was me and I immediately muted myself and said I had to go since either way I had to eat. This taught me a lesson to always check if you are mute or not.,non-suicide

1270,"My younger sister has been suicidal for a long time and of course, I have always tried being there to help and be her punching bag. When am I allowed to give up?My sister (20) has been suicidal/depressed since she was about 13 years old and she has only gotten worse. It began when her closest friends in high school ditched her and turned everyone in her class against her. Since then she hasn‚Äôt ever really recovered - did receive some help around then. She now refuses to seek any more help, says she will deal with it on her own and if it doesn‚Äôt work and she decides to kill herself ‚Äúshe‚Äôs tried her best‚Äù. 

Because of this decision and her being vehemently against any sort of help (she cut our parents out of her life because they tried to make her get help), I have been the only one she can turn to. 

She recently stopped being friends with her last remaining friend. I talk to her whenever she feels like it but it always seems like whatever I say makes her angry when all I‚Äôm doing is trying to help. Her reactions aren‚Äôt that of a normal person so it‚Äôs really hard to try and be there for her and making sure I don‚Äôt make her angry while doing so. 

At this point, it really is affecting my mental health (have been working through my own depression) and I have no idea what to do. I can‚Äôt imagine if the only person I could talk to decided to leave and would never want to but I also can‚Äôt be her punching bag forever. She also says that if I try and make her get help she will hate me and cut me out too. Do I just let her? ",suicide
1272,"I'm patheticI know this is going to sound overly dramatic, but as someone who has considered suicide since they were 8 years old, I jump to ""dramatic"" conclusions quickly. I've been in college for approximately 2 weeks now and I've realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage I am compared to everyone else. I come from a state in the tri-state area and moved to NY (manhattan specifically) for college (living in the dorms) Where I'm from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative, and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town - then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity. Now I go to an art school because, believe me, I'm not capable of doing anything else. I am fucking stupid. And yes, it's expensive to be here. And yes, I got a significant amount of financial aid, and yes, it's still a lot of money. When I moved here, I didn't come with that much money. I've been very good at limiting what I spend, I only spend money on what I absolutely need. On top of college being a lot of money, everything here is also more costly. So money goes quick, even if it's only on essentials. 
Started my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat I couldn't afford all of this. My class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time. I spent 6 hours in that fucking studio class thinking about how I'm going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time. I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things - but I didn't. I left empty handed and feeling like shit. 
On top of school materials, I am practically wearing the same clothes every week because I have so few. I've resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if I can help it. 
I've heard a million different things about student loans and all that bullshit and my head still isn't completely wrapped around about what I have to do and where to do it to make my stupid fucking payments. Don't really want to think about it right now but I'll do it anyways. My parents are helping me out paying for tuition and shit but other than that I'm on my own.
I'm not going to kill myself right away but I would love to open my window and jump from 16 stories down onto the sidewalk and die. I am so fucking alone here and so fucking pathetic. Money doesnt buy happiness but it fucking controls everything that I can't afford.

1290,"It gets worse beyond death.28 y/o divorced male here. With one beautiful son, and he's god sent. That being said, he is a real problem as I cannot handle the thoughts of how he will have to go through with life when I discharge a shotgun in my face. I've considered taking his life as well, in order to spare him.

I am a completely and utterly hopeless romantic. I married my ex-wife after threatening to abort our child (we had an abortion a year before we had our son). The divorce and custody trials are still not over, have lasted over 3 years, and has put me in debt to my family trust for over $50,000. 

I met an absolutely beautiful and exquisite individual over a dating app about two months ago. She fills me with joy and is the most remarkable woman I have ever met. She gave many different types of messages over the past few weeks, which have all been predominantly reassuring. This week my emotions boiled over a bit and I told her how much I want to be with her. Our phone call last night concluded with her telling me, in essence, that my emotional overflow has created a small rift between us and she is in need of the emotions to be removed from our equation. I haven't slept all week, as I've felt like I've been losing her, due to the fact that I have baggage, and am otherwise more invested in this than she is. I've looked all my life for someone like her. I detest the concept of not putting all my eggs in one basket, I've already hooked up with someone else since I met her to do precisely this, and I thought about her the entire time, it made me hate myself and want to purify, and thus, has caused me to overextend my affection and quite honestly appear to not have all my ducks in a line, in addition to how emotionally distraught I was in our most recent conversation. I have a 4-year degree and apply for better jobs on a daily basis, but to no avail, I am living in a high income area, and am no better off than I was a decade ago. I have a huge issue with capitalism, and, coming from both a conservative and military family, am routinely crucified verbally for my lack of personal motivation to seek and act in ways that will project my son and I forward. I have suffered from extreme depression since adolescence, took every antidepressant available in high school, and self medicated with marijuana for a decade. I can't cope with my situation, let alone another great romantic loss, any more than I can cope with the fact that I've never felt capable of overcoming the gravity of my emotions. As a single parent with full custody, options for seeking help are all but plentiful, especially with an ex-spouse eager to reverse the custody situation, who also happens to be in very dire straits financially. 

Assuming I am compromised enough to even consider the destruction of my life, and even that of my sons to spare him pain,  my only real issue is with God. As a frequent lucid dreamer and someone unable to recover from the daily perils of life through an inability to sleep without working through significant karmic events, (I routinely deal with the aftermath of sins such as murder, am imprisoned, or am otherwise finding myself in a deep state of isolated suffering when I dream), I am very much aware of the fact that there exists a life in the ether, and the truth is that my life in the ether is worse than it is in reality. I hate God for the situation that planet earth is currently in, and has been in for thousands of years, I hate that I cannot be at peace, having lived a life where I've tried to be considerate of others, and truly feel that there is no escape whether i commit suicide or not. I've felt this way for decades, and I've deteriorated to the point of complete anguish, where I truly wish to destroy my life and the lives of others as I see the human struggle to be so fickle and grotesque, my mind desires seeking the dark web to sign murder contracts, and then as I let my thinking spiral, I return to a state where I realize that I truly have no desire to hurt anyone, but to completely erase all aspects of myself entirely. No memories, no essence, no soul. Total obliteration and liberation through the end of what has felt like truly a life of magnified suffering. I don't know how to end this, because again, in my mind there is no end no matter what action I take, but I'm so sick and unorganized that it has effected each and every person involved in my life.

1291,"I just need someone to listen to me...Back story: I'm 18, I've been suffering from depression for 3 or 4 years but I don't want to go back to the doctor because I'm scared that they won't take me seriously and think I'm just another teenager. I have never talked about my problems to anyone else because when I try I freeze and am unable to say anything. Over the past couple of years, I have tried to kill myself over 20 times including pills and alcohol and trying to drown myself. 

Now to my current problems:

I came out at gay when I finished my GCSE's at 16. All my friends said they didn't care and all but within 2 months, I only had 2 or 3 friends that would still talk to me. When I went back to the school to pick up my GCSE certificates, about 100 people, all my old friends and classmates included, started shouting insults like faggot and queer, right up until I was 5 minutes down the road and couldn't hear them any more. My best friend at the time stopped talking to me about 2 or 3 months after this incident. My other friend at that time still talked to me and did right up until October 2011 when he stopped talking to me and started doing drugs and all sorts. 
When I went to a new school after a year to start my A Levels, I made new friends, and they would come out with me and smoke weed and such, but then a month ago, they did the exact same thing as my other good friends did and just stopped talking to me, unless they need me for something, usually to ask me for a cigarette.
At this same time, a month or so my last friends, had a baby. Now I understand that they had a baby and all but they just stopped talking to me as well. It's not even that they've not had time due to their child, but they have been going out nearly every day and had time to themselves, but nothing. Now, I have no friends that will talk to me and the only person I've talked to today is my mom and that was about 3 words.

I'm in love with a straight guy in my school. I would talk to him and say how I feel, but I'm scared about what will happen due to my year group in school consisting of a whole 25 people who are all very good friends with each other, plus the way they get on with each other consists of finding something to make fun f someone for and taking the piss out of that for a long time. If I did say anything, my whole year group in school would hear about it within a day and I won't be able to stay there for another year because people will go on about it every day. I can't go to another school as this was the only one I was able to go to since I was previously doing a electrician training course somewhere else.

I'm also poor as fuck. My mom has a lot of health problems and is unable to work. My dad works a job that earns just enough to cover the bills. I've been trying to find a job but somehow, the people with no qualifications at all get picked for jobs instead of me. All my clothes are borderline too small and are at least a year old.

1333,"I don't think i'll kill myself over this but this will definitely up the chancesHi /r/SuicideWatch so there's been a lot going on over the last year or so much more than I feel I want to type up in a post as it could take me all day but basically I've been fighting a losing battle for a while now but small victory's are helping me get through the worst parts for example i passed my driving theory test two days ago :).

Anyway ill give you some background so you can help me with these problems, so around two years ago i was 16 got into my first real relationship with a girl named abbey about 9 months into the relationship she got really drunk at a party she got really angry at me when i told her to slow down a bit and tried to make out with one of my friends at the party needless to say it didn't work he didn't make out with her, for the remaining months of our relationship she acted extremely distant and unloving as i showered her with praise until around February last year I broke up with her. A bad and good break up at the same time as we were both extramly sad but were able to calmly talk to each other and come to an undersanding however my mother through this time told me she was  disappointed in me because I wouldn't get over her in literally two days and said she must of raised me wrong because i'm fucked up anyway.....

Between that time and now I got a job at McDonalds hated it quit got kicked out of my house got forced to move back into my house normal school issues however i don't mind school that much rampant suicidal thoughts and just generally scared of the future and sad at life. Throughout this time abbey would message me now and again and wed talk for a couple of days before i stopped as i never really stopped having feelings towards her so i couldn't talk to her without feeling like shit.

ok so here's the real problem we started talking two months ago ended up started having casual sex weekly i know great idea, said at the begging that if we chose to date people we would be ok with that and would stop this. one of my friends asked her out couple of days ago im not ok with that they went out on a date none of them told me she lied to me about why she couldn't come round and where she went. I worked it out for myself [here are the texts from tmrw to today when i worked it out](http://imgur.com/a/927HO).

 I just read through that and have left a bit out but i hope this gives the general gist of what im trying to say honestly i never fell out of love with her i don't think that's really something i can do but i know she has with me.

1336,"Not sure what to do. My life feels like it's over.Hi I was just directed to this sub.. I'm not even sure where to begin.

I have mental problems/memory issues so if there is a timeline discrepancy or everything is mixed up I'm sorry.

I'm also sorry for the length of the post. You dont have to read it, it's OK.

I'm 31 and have lived an incredibly dismal life. As a child I lived with a single mom, she had me when she was eighteen. She had no aspirations and not much of an education. So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty. Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life. He was extremely cynical of me, and would make me cry pretty well daily. And for some reason I'd cry until I vomited, which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems. It sucks pretty bad when you're eight years old and your own family won't believe you have heatburn. It's like leaving me there to bleed out.  I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach.

By the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a ""special"" class for misbehaved students. This was also in a catholic school. It was an extremely hostile environment, and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I've ever heard. But it's still happening to this day and damaging the lives of  countless children. The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn't very beneficial to a lot of the students. The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there. There were no tests to pass, no work to be graded on. You didn't even have to do anything. 

In grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town, they didn't have behavioral classes, but I made so many friends and things were happy, the days were bright. Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy. We moved in with him. I made more friends, everything was OK I went to school there were no problems (They didn't have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems, we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia)

1337,"I am sick of tryingI really don't know why I bother anymore. My birthday was yesterday and it really just solidified the idea that I don't matter at all, not even a little bit. I always always help through fun birthday parties for people, ever since I've moved ive helped throw and organize 3, one was even a surprise party. I put lots of money and effort into these parties. Its not like I did this to expect anything back, its not that, its just sad when people just dont care. Not one of my close friends posted on my fb, which its just like such an easy thing. Everyone is on fb, everyone sees the birthday notification, but they chose to not even say a word. I know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter. I never ever did to my friends. And its not them its me. I dont deserve to be cared about, im the annoying person that hangs around them and they deal with it and i appreciate that they do but why should I even bother them anymore, theyd be so better off without me. My mother could literally care less that I exist, she is coming home for Christmas and posted a status about how she was so excited to see her mother, her sister in law and her niece. Not a word about me or my sister. She knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb. Not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist. All I am good for is being used occasionally. I am not worth the air I breath. I just take up space and time that other people could be using. I am ugly and fat, and everyone knows it. I can tell people are disgusted by me, and im so sorry that they even have to look at me. I wish I would just disappear, people would only notice because I have duties like getting the bills ready to pay.
My other friend was having a rough time and everyone rushed to her side to help her, to be there for her. But no one cares about me, maybe because i have felt bad on and off for so long, maybe because im disgusting and dont matter, maybe everyone is secretly hoping ill kill myself so they can stop being annoyed by me. the only thing that keeps me here is my pet, and i mean how sad is that. That the only thing that needs me is my pet because he has to because i have to take care of him. I just dont want to try anymore im so sick of trying and im so sick of not mattering. I know it sounds all so stupid but everyone of my friends all care and love each other so much but when it comes to me im just nothing I dont want to leave bed or my room i just want to eat junk food until i cant move and just rot away. Im so digusting and unattractive, no one will ever love me, ill be alone forever, no one will ever care, so why dont i just fucking end it get it over with what the point on sticking around, there is none. I want to end my life so bad, i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape. I know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more. There is no help I can get, ive done it all. Why bother i just dont want to take up space and peoples time anymore i hate being a burden I just dont want this anymore. i want my friends to be happy and have a good life and they dont deserve someone who is disgusting and a nuisance in their life.

I posted here a couple of days ago, x-posted in another sub with very little response. 
I am a female in my midthirties who is severely chronically ill, physically disabled, and unable to drive or work. My condition is such that it is physically impossible for me to live alone. I have been through two awful divorces and am currently trapped in an often abusive engagement to a guy whom I have strong reasons to believe has been unfaithful to me. He is a narcissist. 

Despite negative full panel STD test results, I have continued for six months and counting to experience terrible unexplainable symptoms that appear to only align with an STD. I don't want to be right about my suspicions. My entire life rests upon whether or not my partner did something he shouldn't have done. I literally have no friends nor family to turn to for help if he has betrayed me; absolutely no one. I do not use Facebook. He and I have lived with his mother for a couple of years now and I just made the huge mistake of confiding in both his mother and my partner's sister about my fears. They are beginning to tip my partner off about my suspicions of him.

 Anyone who has been abused and is trapped knows what that can mean. I am freaking terrified now. I have nowhere to go if he finds out that I don't trust him. I convinced him to take me to get retested early next month, but my whole future rides on those results. I have no one to stay with. My mother passed away from a terrible illness one month ago and my father and I do not get along at all. Staying with him is simply out the question. I am entirely alone. Going to a shelter is impossible for me because a physically disabled person is considered a liability and I have experience with being turned away from them already in the past. I have absolutely no recourse in this situation now. I am absolutely terrified and completely freaking alone. Oh God. The only way out of this is death.

I have thoughts. I don't know why I have these thoughts, I think about why I have these thoughts. I think about whether or not the fact that I'm thinking about whatever I'm thinking about means anything, and if it does, what? I don't trust the way my thoughts form. I don't know who I am. I don't know what I am.

I WANT TO DIE. DYING IS ALL I HAVE EVER WANTED TO DO SINCE I WAS 6. I have been depressed, suicidal since I was 6.

I'm crazy. I'm insane. Let me tell you about my day today. This is **ONE** example of a day of mine.

I drove 1000 miles with no break. Why? Because I was bored. For the first 5 hours, I had these thoughts. Thoughts of murder. I felt strange. I just wanted to murder and torture innocent people. I made specific plans to kidnap, rape, torture, and kill some women. I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. I have urges. Every moment of every day, my behavior is different from my thoughts and my intentions. It's as if two entities are possessing me; one controls my mind, the other controls my body.

My parents abused me. A lot. Every day. And the worst part? They genuinely care about me, and that guilted the FUCK out of my child self. Everything about their behavior said ""I hate you. You're worthless. We wish you were dead. Kill yourself."" and they abused my mind EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. But they love me. Their behavior is 100% inconsistent with their thoughts. They're INSANE PEOPLE. They are absolutely batshit insane people, beyond comprehension. They are more insane than I am, and I can feel myself turning into my father more and more every day and the thought that I am becoming like him absolutely crushes me.

I'm worried my urges will get worse. I'm worried I will do something unforgivable before I realize it. I want to die. I want the sweet release of death. Being in this mind is torture. 

I regret every single thing I have done in life. I can't believe I got to this point.

I have no friends, no family, no dreams, no motivations, no likes, no dislikes, no opinions of my own. I am a mindless drone, isolated and spending every second of every day alone with my own thoughts.

Please, talk to me. I tell myself I don't want help, but I do. I want help. I want to be happy. I want to have dreams. I want to make other people smile and laugh with them. I want to have meaningful connections with other people. But I just can't. All I do is send myself farther and farther down the hole.

I wasn't always like this. I had dreams as a very young kid. I was nice to everyone, and just wanted everyone to get along and be happy. I just wanted to be happy, to help others. But my parents FUCKED. ME. UP. THEY DID THIS TO ME. LIVING WITH THEM WAS **ABSOLUTE HELL**.

I'm crying. I'm a 19 year old dude. I look 12, and I feel like a 70 year old man with the mind of a tormented 6 year old. Please talk to me. Ask me questions. I want to fix myself. I want to be happy. I am going to get mental help in about two weeks, but for now, I just need something, ANYTHING. So I turn to you guys. Please, I beg of you. I just want to hear from other people. I want to die more than anything else, but a small piece of me doesn't.

I spent most of this weekend in my bed. I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to. I have a good support network which I'm extremely grateful. The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was 12 or 13. I'm now 27 (M). Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then. In this time, I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity. This adds to my conflict; Do I want to be here? Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it?  


My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated. I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career. During the pandemic and recession, the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances, I am one of these people. I am very grateful for what has been provided to me, but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job.

I know that I'm the common link here, I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I'm mentally ill, but how the fuck do I fix all this? I couldn't deal with another loved one dying from drug/alcohol overdose or suicide. I can't count them on both hands anymore. I know there are people in much worse positions but I can't talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone. Today was a nice day, why am I still like this. It's almost 4am now.

So basicly I know that one of my friends was going to go into the military but he was planning on doing 4 years of ROTC before he went in so we were going to all spend college together, yay right? Well no.

Because apparently to get where they wanted in the military (Special ops and army medic respectively) they would have a better chance if they just enlisted out of highschool AND the minimum enlistment is 5 years... they where thinking about doing 8.....

Like don't get me wrong, I want to see them reach their goals and be happy and I am going to support them and I love them both SO much but its just am so scared of losing them and us drifing apart.

I also feel like i'm such a dick towards everyone, as I don't care about anything anymore, some people are annoyed by my negativity towards everything. 

Being alive is just pain and suffering. I've almost stopped feeling emotions at all, I don't feel empathy towards people anymore, only for animals.

Show me how you hold onto reality in times of unbelievable events.I feel as though there is, at this point, no way for me to come to a conclusion about the validity of some of my thoughts and perceptions. Sometimes, I have a hard time hearing people and I'll just hear gibberish with certain words mixed in that give it various malicious intents. This normally only happens when I have been awake for more than 24 hours. Also, while in this state, I watch myself come off as ignorant or excessively socially awkward while my inner thoughts are quite perceptive of the body language and general mood of the situation. Usually, other people are completely confused, unhelpful, or downright mean and mocking. It feels as if some people never left elementary school.

I have been very confident in the past so I know what it is like to be accepted and to perform in a way that elicits a positive reaction from friends and strangers. This makes the fluctuation between ability to focus/listen for understanding and distraction/anxiety even more frustrating and unpredictable.

Some backstory: Never was socially adept until high school and still had limited success but that was mostly due to my lack of interest in the most popular of culture. I had a small group of friends who also took a long time to warm up to me. I have trusted people less and less as I get older and more experienced with the fact that everyone has lied, can lie, do lie, to cover up something they consider extremely embarrassing or to preserve something they fear losing. The former reason to lie is slightly less annoying than the latter and I automatically assume the person is capable of both great good AND malevolence, a balance everyone sits somewhere on. It is the latter desire to hoard 'precious' objects or people through EXTENSIVE deceit and [Gaslighting]() that has planted the seed of, first, my belief that the exact opposite of what is readily obvious could actually be the REAL truth and, second, the expansion of this to the realization that the webs of proof and science (and CLEARLY religion) are not as perfectly indisputable as most people trust they are. Once this truth is realized it opens the flood gates for endless permutations of possibility, especially using the current theories being worked on trying to define the relationship between thought and matter. I'm sorry if reading this puts you into a similar state but I'm starting to get more and more scared and I really need to know your HONEST opinions about the explanation of so many coincidences that it defies the definition of 'coincidence'. For example, I was driving a car with a girl in the passenger seat and we pull up to a light where a bum holds a sign that reads ""I need a Job and clothes"". I (clearly incredibly insensitively) joke to the girl by saying, ""Hey, yea buddy I need those too..."" Immediately after saying this a car pulls up beside us with a sticker that says exactly: ""You don't need it"". We have a hearty and yet vaguely tense laugh about the 'synchronicity'.

These things are happening more and more often and I could list at least 5 more that are unbelievable enough to honestly build a case for an intelligent force affecting reality in some way. I was not raised religious in any way and, in fact, was a staunch skeptic for most of my life as it pertains to mysticism.

I am very serious, I NEED to know exactly what you believe and **WHY**. The why, preferably, would consist of personal experiences with no alternate explanation OR that initially seemed to have no reason but was later shown to be natural. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me, and undoubtedly more redditors, to find some way to stop constantly taking this factor into account as it pertains to such mundane daily events such as a sign held by a bum causing a damn existential crisis.

Much love for you all, I look forward to your excellent powers of deduction. Yes, I am in a humorous mood, this is not always the case and my emotions can become so acutely anxious that I really don't want to ever feel that specific pain again.",suicide

I have to hand in my graduation thesis by this Friday, but I have not been able to type more than 800 words these last months. I am stuck at my parents' house because of the outbreak and they have already told me that if I don't graduate they will not pay for me to return to college next year just to complete my thesis because they do not believe I will be able to. The thought of having to drop out when I only have this one thing left makes me cry every time, as I've always had a lot of pressure regarding academics. Even if I typed constantly for 48 hours I will probably fail anyway, as I have not kept in touch with my tutor due to my social phobia making it almost impossible for me to reach out, even less when it's by email (and this communication is a very big part of our grade).

This may sound like a stupid reason for ending it all, but honestly when all your life revolves around academics and you know that you will 100% lose all the opportunities that were waiting for you after graduation the future just seems like a dark void of nothingness. 

I think that all this time I had just been looking for a good reason to actually kill myself, and right now all I can think about is how big of a failure as a person I am. Even my therapist has been pressuring me to finish my thesis and graduate and then focus on my problems during summer, but I just cannot deal with all this pressure and all the negative thoughts that have been stopping me from being productive this last year.

I hate what I've become. I used to be witty, clever, and fun, but now I'm just a black hole that absorbs other peoples energy. It feels like I've lost the ability to feel true happiness. I feel like my life ended when my childhood ended. Everything I did after childhood were just failed attempts at feeling good again.

  


Lately, I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night, until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot. Then, I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment. I get the urge to physically punish myself. Sometimes, I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg. Sometimes, I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out, although it has nearly killed me once in the past. After a while, the emotions pass on, and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing, until the cycle repeats. I've lost interest in all the things I liked to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint, but the feeling passes quickly, and then I go back to feeling like shit.

  


I think about suicide at least a couple of times a day, but I can't kill myself cause there are people who actually care about me. I sometimes lose control over my actions though, so I'm scared I might actually try again. I've attempted suicide 7 times throughout my late teens while I was heavily struggling with drugs, but luckily I never succeeded. I haven't had a proper diagnose yet, but I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. The bipolar symptoms have been present all my life. The others slowly developed over time. I have a first appointment with a psychiatrist this week. I doubt that talking alone will help much though. I'm hoping that medication will help me feel better. I probably should change some things in my life, but I can't do that as long as I feel the way I do now.",suicide

I have nobody, not even the person who shares mutual love with me wishes to spend some time with me and at least hear me out now because of my mood.

Speaking of moods, I'm in a fairly dangerous one. Not for others, mind you, I don't believe in harming other people for no good reason. My mood is hazardous to my own health.

Most days I'm suicidal anyway but most days I have some level of hesitation or disinterest in death and serious issues with pain. Today I find myself quite lacking in caution, self-preservation instinct, and the ability to care whether or not I live or die.

On top of all this I have work in about 1 1/2 hours and I'm not even sure I can make it all the way there without dying spectacularly.


EDIT: Oh right, lest we forget, the biggest reason I can't talk to anyone is because they're all as messed up as I am and adding to their worries will only cause more of a headache for me and is exactly the same as adding to my own problems, especially if I decide to stick around.

Ashamed of how I look and how I walk and even how my arms move every single fucking time. No friends, no hopes and dreams, no talents, why am I keep living? People I thought I was friends with, turned out to be fake and literally no one contacts me first and even I do first, they always ignore me.

I was raised by pretty averaged parents, no traumatic events or something  but I'm here, having social anxiety, BDD and depression who literally can do nothing but cooped up in home all day long and constantly thinking about how horrible human being I am.

I have literally zero self-esteem that if someone said something mean to me I don't even get pissed because I know how horrible creature I am more than anybody else. At this point, death seems the only way to get out of here.",suicide

I know i do. Even though i never knew you. Knowing that a human died when i could have stopped that with a few words of encouragement would surely bring me over my breaking point.

1474,"Hey, Lar...[home](http://i.imgur.com/8nD5j.jpg)

Your arms were the only ones in which I was truly loved and safe. Yeah, I get it: your own parent not wanting you. After you died, Mom made it really clear I was a nuisance. 

She left me with pedophiles, more than one, with me literally begging and screaming for her not to walk out that door while they sat there awaiting the pleasure they'd take with me the second she left. Even if she was in the next room, or taking a quick shower, I was the fuckdolly.

Did you know that one of them was at me for years? Yeah, he'd kill my pets to keep me quiet. Another one of her boyfriends. Had my childhood dog, EB, for years...he drowned her in the bathtub. He killed several. Told me Mom would hate me if she ever found out that I had turned him on so much that he had to fuck me until he was ""completely satisfied"". Yeah, she managed to throw this in my face when she found out - jealousy over maternal instinct. She's a fucking abusive cunt. This was along with all the violent beatings he laid on mom and me, not to mention that he kept us indoors and isolated for years...aside from the times he was in and out of prison.

Know how all this came out? He knocked me up at the ripe old age of 13. I had to have an abortion. He was going to be charged with several things, not just for the sexual part, but unlawful confinement, too. 
Did you know that Mom always treated me like a nuisance, even before the pedos...telling me that she wished I'd never been born, screaming, ""Are you fucking retarded?!"" if I did something kids normally do, such as accidently tipping my juice over at breakfast or took too long doing dishes. Enter her violent blowups, slaps, punches, being dragged around by my hair while she screamed visciously. Bitch loved to slam her fist between my shoulder blades when I didn't even see it coming. I lived in constant fear in childhood. I acted out...not knowing how to relate to others, alienating my peers at school. No friends...the girl everyone scorned. There was no comfort when I was told ""No one likes you!"" with such vehemence that it still burns in my memory to this day. You have no idea how this has isolated me...fuck people. Not going anywhere near them. Isolation is my greatest defence. When you have it drilled in your head that you're unwanted, it sticks so deeply. It burns into the deepest trenches of your being.
Mom dragged to that fucking tiny hellhole she's from. Think that went well? You know the one...where they're tighter than thieves. I was so beaten down and shy, of course they took it as me thinking I was better than them. I couldn't even look anyone in the eye, I was so shy. The curled their upper lip when I'd pass by. I did nothing to deserve this. I never hurt any of them, I'd only wanted to be accepted. It didn't help that her next ""husband"" tried to convince me I'm crazy because I only knew to isolate and couldn't talk to anyone. I love my mom, no matter what she did, and I'd call him on his obnoxious behaviour towards her and it made us enemies. I hated him deeply as he was a bully, and knew she'd do anything in her codepent, clingy way to keep him. He'd told me ways of disposing of bodies and not get caught...told me he would have killed my mother once if I hadn't walked in the room. He'd sliced up the mother of his son to the point that he'd had served time in a criminal psch ward, and arrogantly defended his actions, going on about how she deserved it and how much he hated her. Whenever he didn't like someone, his first comment was that ""there was something wrong with them in the head"". Holy fuck...pot calling the kettle black or what, eh?There's can't really be anything truly wrong with me...I was just kicked around too much, wasn't I? Please tell me I'm not crazy...it's eaten away at me for years. I know rationally I'm not crazy, but this fucking neurotic bullshit eats at me. I was truly happy when he died...he was evil. I'd rather have O'brien and the other pedophiles than him. Fuck, everyone thought he was so ""nice""...good old ""uncle rick"". Piece of motherfucking shit...even his corpse is a waste of space.
Did you know that mom got a lot of money from criminal injuries when you died? She was supposed to save it for me, but spent it on herself, a house and her boyfriends. I was lucky to fucking eat, or get rags from fucking thrift stores for clothes. She still gets cheques each month while your grandkids sit in poverty. I took out student loans trying to make something of my self and the debt of it is fucking crushing. I nearly finished my degree, but trying to make it on my own with the kids too soon after birth nearly killed me. Postpartum depression and the stress of it all, I've tried to be strong.  The kids dad left even before your grandaughter was born. I gave birth to her, going to university full time and still made the first year winning a scholarship. I struggled against depression best I could, but I dropped out three times over the years, each time summoning stubborn strength to meet the goal of graduating. Three strikes, I was out. No more access to means to finish. No jobs to cover tuition, loans wiped their hands of me, understandably. My own stubborn will to try and complete blew up in my face. Left with lots of theory and all the pretentious academic terms to describe them, but not one practical skill from it all. Nonetheless, you grandkids - You'd be so fucking proud of those two...hearts of gold and that sparking humour and brains we got from you, certainly not her. I know you'd have spoiled us...Mom told us that you really, really loved me more than anything you'd ever in your life. I know that if you were as ga ga over me as you were, you'd be twice as much over them. Nonetheless, we struggle...I've been so isolated for most of my life. O'brien, Mom, that hellhole she dragged me to, settling for the prick of a biological father and more isolation trying to raise the babies in a two bedroom apartment for years, not a soul to turn to. Not a way to reach out as the isloation eroded any sort of chance to build the means to reach out, connect and bond with anyone. We're stuck in poverty...there's no fucking jobs in this fucking dead end town, and even if there were, I freeze, paralyzed when I try to interact. They won...I get it: I'm stupid, I'm crazy, and I'm unwelcome. I am not allowed to be, life if for ""other people"". 

From what Mom tells me, you would have have stood before stampedes to protect me...I was the apple of your eye, you loved me because I was the only thing you ever loved or were loved by. Fuck, all this shit is just the tip of the iceberg. I spoke to your little sister, without telling her my intentions, and she'd be happy to take the kids in case anything happened to me. They're better off without me, I'm so fucking stressed out and scared all the time...snarling and isolating from them and everyone else in the world. They'd be better off with her. They're the only things I love in this world, but I'm no good for them. Daddy, please...I'm so fucking scared...I'm so fucking shoved away. I tried, I really truly did. I've tried to get education and make things better...I've tried to be the best person I can, but nothing helps. Please...take me back to  you. Just hold me in your arms, make it all go away. I've given it my best shot, but over three decades of this shit truly has me worn down. I can't go on like this. I need to be back in your arms where we loved each other and we were home. At the time I could afford it, I had a gravestone made for you as I'd spent years looking for your grave and no one told me that you were so uncared for that no one had bothered. Your own father...my mother. Both had the means to do so, but hey, it was all about them, you know? I just had your name tattoed on me to honour you, proudly carrying you with me forever, so you know that yes, someone loved you sincerely. I can't do this anymore, however. I've struggled and tried to do my best. I just want to be back with you. No one wants me here, I'm not allowed to live and shouldn't be. I'm not welcome, I'm unwanted...got it. Loud and clear. PLEASE Just take me back home to you, Daddy,I've tried so hard - just take me back - I don't want to be here. PLEASE, I fucking beg you...

1485,"I hate my health...I'm 20 years old, male, and I've got problems.  I grew up in an abusive family, and I'm still living here.  I'm about to postpone college so I can move out, but those are little things.

My health has been failing for the past several years.  I've developed a shit ton of food allergies... I can barely eat anything, and with what little I can, it's impossible to get all the vitamins needed for my body to function correctly... and that leads to even more problems, and it's alot more than you might think at first... The list of things I can eat is literally shorter than the list of things I can't.  Even trace amounts of food that I can't have will trigger a response.  If someone drinks out of something, then kisses me, I'm screwed for about 2 months.  At first, I'll be in pain.  The other symptoms are almost like having the flu, and then I'll be extremely tired.  Sometimes I'll pass out one day, and wake up two days later.  I'll be very tired like this for about a week to a month.  The pain will last a day, sometimes more, but it's the more visible effects that get to me the most.  The skin on my face will explode into pimples and my entire face will be covered with a red rash.  This is the part that lasts for about 2 months... I've been to 4 different allergy doctors, a dietitian, and a dermatologist, and none of them could help me.  The longer I avoid the foods, the worse the responses seem to be... and they're almost inevitable.  If a dish isn't washed well enough, I'll react to it.  If a knife was placed on a counter, I'll react to whatever it's used to cut.  Lots of fruits are covered in a corn based wax, which I react to, and even companies that I'm used to buying canned tomatoes or anything as basic as that will switch their ingredients before they switch the label, then there goes 2 months of my life.  If I react to something 1 out of every 100 days, then 60% of the time, I'll have to deal with these symptoms.  On top of that, I'm also diabetic.

It doesn't end there either.  If I get sick, it usually lasts about 5x-10x longer for me than for other people because my immune system is focused on tracking down pollen and food particles; so it doesn't invest anywhere near as much resources to fight bacteria and disease as a normal person's would.  I'd give more information, but I'm already pretty identifiable as it is.

Lately, I've been really losing touch with reality... my problems are so unrealistic, I question them myself sometimes, but they've consistently proven themselves to be real....  I've held a gun to my head 3 times since december, but I've been too pussy to pull the trigger...  I heard of a cure that might work, but it's illegal in the U.S. and costs over $3k, and my parents refused to fund it, even though they buy and rent out houses for a living... she rubbed it in my face too.... I'm really not sure my sanity will last long enough to get there myself.

I just feel completely fucked and betrayed by my own genetics.  I've read plenty of books about my problem, and I've done alot of research determined to cure myself, but again, my sanity won't last me that long... sorry for the wall of txt.",suicide

1493,"I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting/ poetic justice
Is that the right term?? This is what I mean:

As far as I know, my school‚Äôs never had a suicide. If anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. It would have the biggest effect if it was me. It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn‚Äôt be SURPRISED. 
I was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it. I was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for NO REASON. Or at least nothing in my control. Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. 
I have been depressed for about the last 2 years. And I have very very few friends and no social life at all. Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible. I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me. I just burst into tears writing this. I didn‚Äôt deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for 4 years üò≠üò≠

If I killed myself, all those kids would think ‚ÄúShe really did it‚Äù and would say ‚ÄúWE drove her to this‚Äù and kids at neighbouring schools would say ‚ÄúYou know (my name) who got picked on? She committed suicide‚Äù and ‚ÄúA girl from (my school) killed herself!‚Äù And ‚ÄúEveryone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs (my name) so it‚Äôs okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it‚Äôs nothing‚Äù and now she‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe (definitely) reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double. Maybe that was my purpose after all. Also no one would care if I wasn‚Äôt there.
I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout ‚ÄúGET OUT LARA. NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE.‚Äù in such a sincere way. They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there. 

No one really cares about me. Or maybe they all care, just not enough. 

The only way people would care about me is if I was dead. Similarly, I‚Äôve been thinking.. what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all, forever?

I don‚Äôt want to stall too much so that I‚Äôve left school when I do it because then the school won‚Äôt take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn‚Äôt because of them. I don‚Äôt want the wrong people to be blamed. 

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can go on. It‚Äôs like a candle is burning, and I don‚Äôt know how much is left of it (height) but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn‚Äôt much. 

It wouldn‚Äôt be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour.",suicide
1494,"I want to kill bullies, not even my bullies, any bully.I want to kill everyone who harassed me throughout life. Realistically, I can't kill them all at once without getting caught in the process. I could settle on killing 20 bullies and then myself.

Also, when I attended elementary school, sometimes they'd place me in an in school detention room and each kid was always black except for me (white), I was usually sent there by the teacher who on several occasions purposely bent over to ""help me"" with my school work and her shirt would be loose and expose her breasts.

Its a hard outlook on life, but hell once I wrote it down I can tell you I felt a lot better. I post this in hopes to help you. It's very lenghty and probably many grammatical errors, but I the tears were in my eyes and the voices in my head were distracting me, so I did my best. And Best of luck to you all. I believe if you can read this and face it as the truth, you can make it through this, just as I did. Because you start seeing things as no overall point. If I were to try to put it in words you could understand it would be you start taking ""risks"" and with risks comes ""reward"". You won't even notice it at first. But it will be there.

I would have to say, to one guy, just one guy, there is no point. No point. None. I simply don't see how you can disagree, you cannot give me a valid reason to why there is with actual evidence or supporting details, you can't. I dare you to try, I dare you to tempt fate. It's simply put at that, there is no point. It's all just there, you can't put it together, you can't write it out, because if you were to try, there would be no point. Do you get where I'm headed? Of course you don't. Because I'm headed no where, because there is no point. It has been shown over and over again in every way possible, people are just to blind to see, that they put words to it to try and make sense. But yet, there is none. No sense. There is nothing this world wouldn't give, to fill it with sense. To give it a point. There is no knowledge, there is none. How can you possibly say you know, when you yourself haven't known before. Can you just simply believe it, because they tell you so? There is no knowing, there is no point. I'll try and put it into terms that we have all agreed upon, and believe it to be real. It's trial and error, guess and check, nothing else. There is no point. So how can we all decide, what to put behind this? When you yourselves, don't know.Is there such a thing as success, or has it been around so long that what used to be just faith and hope, turned into our reality. How do you know?.....  How do you know? Take it to yourself to think. Has the hope and thought of success become something, the one thing, that we all humans agree upon? Letters and numbers. It's all just how we put together the everything, the everything of nothing. There is no point. We simply must agree that there is no such idea. How many times must it be shown to us, that there is no point. There is a such thing as nothing, and it is everything that we see. Just what we have agreed upon makes it something. Why can't we allow the thought of being ""unhappy""? What makes it unhappy, and to whom? Does that really justify what can make one happy or not? Have we just been so worn out with the fight of being ""unhappy"" that we seek happiness? But can it really be sought? How can you deny something to not be right, when it never leaves you? It never leaves you, it will always appear, and come upon us. So can we embrace it, can't we all just let it happen? Why do we continue to escape it, when all it does is return, harsher, as if it were angry at us? We have left it for too long. I have left it for too long. I will not change, I will not cheer, I will not forget that it is here. It's inside us. The only thing you have to do is look deep enough. When faced with the chance to escape it, I will, just as we all would, but I will not forget. I will allow it to come back upon me. I will surrender to it. Maybe, just maybe, it won't forgive me. 

Even now I am still holding to grips with myself and how I will always be ""unhappy"" I probably wont call it this for very much longer, because its not really being ""unhappy"" its more of human nature. We have grown out of ourselves, we have become distant with our nature, our true meaning and being, the true meaning and being that there is no true meaning to it. We are just here, and we cant accept it now. Its been too long, why oh why cant the people just see? We aren't here for a reason, we just are, it happened, so what. Live with it, there is no need to find this out, so there is no need to find anything else. Do what you are good at and that should be suffice to what makes you ""happy"". It's more of a fit in your place that you were put sort of thing. We are toys to a creation that is and forever will be beyond our understanding. We will never know, so we can just stop trying and ignore the subject. I will go as far to say as I am no longer an Atheist. However I will not bring my understanding of something of which I can not understand into my own reality that I have thus created so far.  This is something that I am going to leave alone and go on with my day, because does it really matter? Does it? Back to being a toy. We are all one, we have no right to do otherwise, we need to find what we can do, and do it. No questions. Don't think about what you do. Just do it. If you are needed elsewhere something will call for it. But what you are doing is what you must. Because that is what we have given the title, ""happiness"". What we are made to do, individually. But its simply beyond that, the concept is made up. Its just to keep us in our places, but we have made it be for so long, well that happiness has become something, and with anything that is something, there is always the opposite. We made an opposite to nothing, something that isnt there. So how can we break from this cycle? Well just remember. No feelings. Do what you are meant to do. We can think with our own brains to figure out what that is. And follow it, but once feelings get involved, you need to drop it. and think again. It's something that must be done. In order to break the cycle. Of which we have named, ""Depression and happiness"".",suicide

1520,"I'm going to kill myself by the end of this monthI'm a 19 f. I've contemplating the idea of killing myself before whenever i was depressed on my pre-teen years, anyway i never did it 'cause deep inside me i knew it was my depression doing the thinking, not my brain. Now, years later, is the first time im actually thinking about it without being depressed. I've, for the first time, analyzed everything with a critical mind. Life just makes no fucking sense. The way the world works, is the most stupid system that anyone could come up with, im here now all down and fucking desperate because i can't get a job. Im all suffocated by the senseless concept that money is. I've been trying to get a job since i finished school 3 years ago but here none hires you if you have no experience, you are ugly or they just don't fucking know you. People here only hire friends of friends. I can't push myself here 'cause. Here's the thing. I can't talk. This has been my biggest problem my whole miserable life since i remember. I don't know how to talk to people . I can't express myself, i can't even go to the grocery store alone to buy shit. i've had social anxiety in the past, i've been homeschooled the last 2 years of high school. All my problems are originated by my lacking social skills. I've always blamed this on my family for rising me like shit making me grow up to be the selfish incapable of talking piece of shit that i'm now. I always hated everyone for not liking me. I only have one friend, and she and my two siblings are the only people i talk to. I mean don't even ""talk"" to them, i just answer whatever shit they tell me. BUT FINALLY i realized that i have none but myself to blame for this shitty life im living. I fucking hate myself. I can't believe I lived so long without realising it.I fucking hate myself for isolate me and push everyone away from me. I could have had so many friends but i pushed them away, i never did anything nice for anyone. I can't fucking think on one stupid small good thing i ever did for anyone. I never hugged anyone honestly. I've never been to a party. I've never told anyone that i liked them, I was never told neither. I've never kissed anyone. There are so many things i never did 'cause i decided that the rest of the world wasn't worth it. And now i see this things i always blamed on my upbringing and oh jesus im the only one to blame, im so miserable. i hate myself so much for it. The worst part is that now i want to change that but i can't cause i was never given the tools to do so. I was always alone. I don't know how to reach out for anyone. I honestly don't know what im supposed to do. My sister was the only pilar in my life but yesterday she decided to stop helping me 'cause i never did anything with the help she gave me. She is fucking right, i hate seeing her waste her life trying to help a lost cause like me. I live with my brother and he tries to talk to me but all i do is scream at him and tell him to leave me alone. I have problems, i'd went to the therapist before, i've had like four different doctors over the past years, but they never helped me 'cause i never told them anything, they only asked me stuff and i answered them or i even let my mother answer the questions for me. Now i have no money to go to a shrink. I have no job, my brother doens't have a job and i just can't do anything to get one. I have no parents nor family besides my siblings. My sister who was the only support i had, decided to stop helping me and now Im here all alone in the dark in my room wondering how a piece of living shit like myself could get to the end of the month. Im fucking desperate. I have no tools to face what is comming. I don't even want to die. There are so many things i want to do but i cant because of how i am. I don't want to die, i just don't want to be myself anymore I fucking hate the person i've become. i can't ""un-become"" me. i don't know how, i don't even think that that's possible. i hate living in my skin.

I just wanted someone to know this. How i am feeling. To hear my feelings before i fade. I won't send or tell this to any of the 3 people i have left. I know they can't help me. The only person that can help me right now is me. but im not able to. i gave myself an ultimatum of 10 days left to figure it out. if i don't find a solution on this lapse i'm going to kill myself.

1533,"Just exhausted of continually feeling this way, and it's not bound to get any better.The past 6 months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me. In the time that's passed, I've experienced the following:  
* Experienced the end of my first adult love, leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me, and even if they did they'd just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway
* Lost the majority of my friends after this, and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I've been reluctant to reach out to them.
* Almost didn't graduate from college but barely got by, and found myself neck-deep in student loan debt.
* Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet, while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another. This has gotten to the point where I don't even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding.
* Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use. Also generally work graveyard hours, but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all.
* A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful, frequent headaches
* Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major, but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt
* Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day, to a point where I just don't want to deal with it anymore.  

I'm just so *tired* and I can't see this getting any better. The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened, but as time passed I started leaning more towards it, quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home. The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won't have to see them, because it always ends the same way - with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances. I don't have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either, as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I've regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back. I did want to further my education, but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring, along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring.  

I think I'm at my breaking point. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to tolerate this anymore. I know I'm on the younger end of the spectrum and there's the unknown that's waiting for me or whatever, but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take, and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once. I hate to think of using it as an easy way out, but at this point I really just don't want to deal with the pain, depression, and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day.",suicide

Personally, suicidal thoughts are the only thing that get me through the week. I think to myself that I'll do it Saturday night and I just bide my time till then. It makes me feel relieved inside to think about not having to deal with anything anymore. Only thing stopping is me is being scared of actually doing it.

However there is one thing, I feel like i have fundamentally changed. It is really hard to explain but its like a part of me didn't come back. But rather is just sitting there dead. My feelings all seem very superficial, I can laugh, smile, cry, yell, but nothing seems to truly move me.

I already know that they don't like people like me so I need to keep my life under wraps.  They're all the most loving, caring people, and every day I feel so incredibly guilty that someone like me has this kind of family when other, more deserving people don't, and so scared that I will lose everything I've ever known.  And, every single day I think about how good it would be to just let go of everything.  I already take things sometimes that I shouldn't take in order to forget about life for a few hours - I might zonk out on painkillers for a while, or take a packet of nytol to escape reality.  I'm not an addict - I could go without them, but I choose to take them every now and again because I can't deal with the way things are.  Cowardly, I know, but that's me in a nutshell.

1578,"It's All My Fault.*No it isn't.
*

**Yes it is.**


I'm in a strange emotional state right now. I don't know how I should be starting my story.  I don't know what I'm supposed to say. But I'll try to make it as clear as possible.


My house has never been one to display much affection. Thats not to say we don't love each other, or someone is overtly abusive, but emotions are not shown very often (do I care too much? or maybe I don't care at all and I'm faking it.) As a result, communication is a major issue and it strains relationships often. Another thing to note is that my brother and I are first generation here (parents were refugees from Viet Nam).

My father never graduated high school. He began working early and came over to the states as a group sponsored by a church. All his life, he has done manual labor of some sort, and currently works as a mechanic at a self-owned (although beginning to fail) mechanic shop. Despite all this, he will never *ever* pass by an opportunity to help someone, whether it is through money, work, or otherwise. In my eyes, he is practically a saint, despite some minor flaws (gambling, which he has fixed, and a little bit of drinking). This is because no matter what, he will help and expect nothin in return. He sees everyone as being equal and will do anyone a favor with a smile on his face, even though it may end up costing him. Throughout my childhood, he was (and still is) working six days a week, from 7AM to 7PM at the shop, and sometimes even as late as 9PM. He works all day, and he works hard, even though the business is meager, he still does all he can to contribute whatever he can towards our home. Because he worked so much, I could never see him  often, and as a child, I always saw him as a kind of distant figure that deserved all my respect, but I never quite knew why. Of course, now that I have grown older (19) I fully understand how much he has sacrificed throughout the years in order to give my brother and I what we wanted and what we needed growing up. I love him more than words can explain for it, and my absolute biggest regret is not spending more time with him and being closer. Don't get me wrong, he's still healthy and alive, but I just wish I could get closer to him, but I dont know how. At all. And it kills me.

My mother was one of the ""boat people"" that fled Viet Nam, leaving her parents when she was only 15. At only a week out to sea, however, her boat was caught up by a Chinese (Hong Kong)? patrol boat, and all the members on board were sent to a detention camp in Hong Kong. Thankfully, because this was towards t he end of the conflict, they were able to negotiate her and the others release and passage to America (due to political asylum or something. I can't recall). When she arrived (living with her aunt/uncle who were already here at the time) her first order of business was to get a job and finish high school. After that, she perservered and went on, despite having limited English skills, to graduating both college and pharmacy school to become a pharmacist. Again, my mom is the type of person to go out of her way to help people, even if it costs her, as evident to the tens of thousands of dollars we constnatly wire back to Viet Nam to aid relatives. (However, she has a quick temper. And I mean quick.) On one hand, I guess you could say I'm closer to my mom than my dad, since she had more education, so I could talk with her with more advanced topics and for some reason I could just chat with her better in general, but on the other, I just felt that there was always a kind of ""barrier"" between us, as if I had some understood yet unspoken relationship with my dad that I just didn't have with my mom.

I know this is getting long, and I doubt anyone will read it thoroughly. I just want to note that at this point, I have mostly calmed down, and my thoughts are getting more lucid. However, I feel like writing this is something that I truly need to write to let it out. Furthermore, the nature of my ""issue"" is something that has and probably will recur constantly, so, while I am in control of my thoughts, I figure pre is better than post.

As you can see from my descriptions, I hold both of my parents in very high regards, to the point where, when I was younger (and to a certain extent, even now), I could see them do no wrong. Growing up, everything I did, I did it to make them happy, to please them, to constnatly seek their approval. And even now, I see nothing wrong with that, especially when I consider that everything I have now, is because they gave up on their dreams or sacrificed their goals in order to provide. And I am truly, eternally  grateful. I feel like it is a debt that can only be repaid by living my life through and raising my own children, providing them with the same (albeit unspoken) love and care that my parents have shown me. I have learned so much as a person from each of them, the foremost being the importance of family and love from my father, and the necessity of knowledge, determination and respect from my mother. Again, I cannot fully encompass the gratitude I have towards them and the debt that can never be repaid. However, this is where the problem begins.

Even at a young age, if my parents ever fought each other, or got mad at me or my brother (regardless of fault) I would blame myself. I would not tell them I blamed myself, but in my heart, I felt that whatever unhappiness that was visited upon them was my fault. And thus, I always strove to do as they told and avoid upsetting them.This worked fine, until I'd say starting about 5 or 6 years ago, when family issues began cropping up.

As I mentioned earlier, my mom was quick to anger and had very low tolerance for mistakes or disrespect. My dad is very quiet and softspoken, and often will take t he blame, in order to diffuse any situation. (For that, respect him immensely. Seriously. His ability to maintain composure was astounding.) When my brother began to reach *that age* where everything and everyone is out to get you, a lot of fights broke out in the family, because my brother thought my mother was too overbearing and my mother disliked how disrespectful and ""americanized"" my brother was becoming. Needless to say, fights often ended in tears while my father was trying his hardest to calm everyone down, and I sat isolated trying to maintain composure (but of course, blaming myself and trying to find a way to keep the family together. As I said earlier, from my dad, I developed a kind of ""do everything I can"" mentality towards my family. I refused to become a broken statistic). The fights grew in number, and volume, my brother became more rebellious, my father began getting tired, etc etc.

Fast forward to the present. I know this is getting long, and to be honest, everytime I write something, I realize I have more to write, but keep in mind this is nearly two decades of bottled up emotions that no one has heard.

1583,"Not sure I even have the energy to type thisBut here goes. I tried to kill myself last Saturday night. I took 15 pills of codeine and valium with whiskey but evidently it wasn't enough. My girlfriend broke up with me and I thought it was over for good but she came back and talked me through it. It wasn't just the perceived end of the relationship that I attempted suicide over though, that was just the last straw. I've had derealisation-depersonalisation disorder from smoking weed for 14 years and severe OCD for 13. The former manifests as agoraphobia and I have been stuck in a rural shithole trying to get help for it all from a local health trust in special measures for almost as long. Everyone I ever love leaves me. I seem to always piss my girlfriend off just by being myself. She is the only good thing in my life but we can't have a normal fight, it always has to end with a potential breakup and tonight she seemingly doesn't want anything to do with me again. It's my fault but I just don't know how to fix it. All this ha sort of compounded to the point where I just don't want to be me anymore, even if I'm nothing. I'm not good enough for my girlfriend, I am too mentally ill to contribute meaningfully to society and I fucked my one chance at a good deeth last weekend by taking too many but also not enough pills so now I'm just slamming my head against shit and jamming knives that aren't sharp enough into my arm.

Not beautiful women, but women I thought were plain-looking or somewhat ugly too. One girl went out with me out of sheer pity, but she couldn't bear the ugliness after a few days and broke it off.

Even my mom reminds me of it every time I call. I'm 33, so she shows my headshot to prospective girls and their moms. She relays their extremely hurtful comments to me, and I am starting to think she knows how devastating it is to hear, and *wants* me to off myself. I realize the shame in being the only one of your friends whose son isn't married and has never had a girlfriend at 33. Financially I'm good, am average height, not fat, dress well, but my face, oh god.

Even when I avoid calling home and the awful thoughts start to go away, I'm bombarded with romance in almost every TV show or movie I watch, no matter how male-oriented. I'll be doing fine for weeks and then some love interest on the TV will send my mind into hysterics, never shutting up about dying. I might even just screw up at work, and my mind will just melt into a jumble of never-ending ""boil yourself alive you ugly dumb fuck"" thoughts.

I've tried hobbies, but the ones I've gotten into all involve people, and I can feel the disgust and hate, or sometimes sympathy, people have for me by looking at me - I've dealt with it my whole life, from being punched in the face and pinched as a toddler to being treated extremely coldly by teachers despite being extremely quiet and being top of my class. I even tried religion it's too fucking hard to get into paradise. I'd join my local Freemason Lodge but that involves a lot of speaking and it turns out I'm complete shit at that too.

Honestly the only thing stopping me, and it's quite big, is the work that'd go into it. I don't want anyone cleaning up the mess so it'd have to be in the ocean. And I'd have to clean out my apartment and find a place for everything. But lately I've been caring less about that all and a bottle of some illegal sedatives starts to sound pretty nice.

Surely there's some reason ugly people like me find to stay alive? How do they keep their mind off their ugliness? Any tips? Good hobbies where I can avoid the anxiety?",suicide

1645,"I‚Äôm trying so hard to get betterTo start off, if I could only receive constructive comments and no ‚ÄúI relate to that‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel the same way‚Äù etc because I can‚Äôt handle the weight of other people‚Äôs struggles right now, because I can‚Äôt even handle my own. Thank you

I‚Äôve deal with mental health struggles for as long as I can remember. My mom told me I had my first anxiety attack at age 3. There‚Äôs never really been anything bad happening in my life. It‚Äôs always been within me. Which makes it even harder sometimes, because unlike a certain event or situation, you will always be with yourself and your thoughts. I‚Äôve been in therapy since 7th grade (I‚Äôm now in 10th), but I definitely could‚Äôve used it sooner. 

I‚Äôve been through many ups and downs in the past 2 years, and I recently came out as transgender (female to male) which has made my life so much more complicated. I lost my friends since childhood, and then another group of friends. I stopped going to traditional public school this year. I‚Äôve self harmed, been clean, and relapsed. I thought I was doing better until a few months after I left outpatient at the start of the summer. 

Everyone says I‚Äôve been making really good progress over the years, but I‚Äôve never been this close to suicide on a daily basis. I can‚Äôt deal with my gender identity, I‚Äôm constantly doubting wether I‚Äôm trans but simultaneously experiencing crippling gender dysphoria. I‚Äôm disassociating really hard every day (I‚Äôve experienced disassociation since middle school but never for this long or this intense), I don‚Äôt even recognize my face, body, voice, or even the things I say or the way I act. I feel like a shell of the person I last remember being. Even taking a step back to analyze my thinking I can‚Äôt even comprehend who‚Äôs thoughts they are. I‚Äôve stopped talking to people about the fact that I no longer experience a will to live because no one can do anything about it, it just hurts others and makes me feel more hopeless. I‚Äôve always felt like there‚Äôs something else wrong with me that hasn‚Äôt been diagnosed, but maybe that‚Äôs the hypochondria. Thus far I‚Äôve only been diagnosed with Anxiety, OCD, and Depression. I haven‚Äôt self harmed in awhile, but it‚Äôs just because I know it doesn‚Äôt really help and hurts those around me. 

The only way I can describe it is that I‚Äôm a cicada. I have a shell on the outside that I‚Äôve shed a few times, but now I‚Äôm stuck in one shell. I no longer exist to the outside world, just the shell of whatever state of being I felt connected to last. I don‚Äôt even feel like a person anymore. I have no idea who I am even on the deepest level. I‚Äôve been on autopilot for so long. I‚Äôve tried to get better for so long. I can‚Äôt remember a time that I wasn‚Äôt mentally struggling. It feels like life will never be different for me, it‚Äôs like that‚Äôs just how god designed me. 

I‚Äôm tired of people telling me ‚Äúit‚Äôll get better‚Äù, ‚Äúit won‚Äôt be like this forever‚Äù, ‚Äúyou can keep going‚Äù. This is all I‚Äôve ever known. Mental turmoil with short periods of feeling ok. And I can‚Äôt see any possible way out. No matter where I go, or where I run, the problem is in my head. I can‚Äôt escape it. I can only distract from it for a short amount of time. I can‚Äôt even remember to eat sometimes now. I forget to do the most basic things. I can never make decisions, so I‚Äôm probably not gonna kill myself anyway. It‚Äôs too much to plan and I know I‚Äôll probably forget something important. It‚Äôs permanent and drastic, and I don‚Äôt do well with making permanent drastic decisions. 

I‚Äôm just hoping someone will finally say something that clicks for more than a few days, or I‚Äôll suddenly realize something, or I‚Äôll find something that lets me see the light at the end of the tunnel. Feel free to ask questions, even if they‚Äôre personal. I‚Äôm desperate.",suicide

1658,"I can't speak.Ever since I was a child, I've had a stutter. Not a mild one, think of the Kings Speech; that one hits closer to home.

I spent my school life listening to everyone chat, laugh, sing, whisper, but could never do it myself. I would sit in the classroom, at my allocated spot at the table hearing questions being thrown out to the room which I knew the answer to; and beyond all other wanting in that moment, all I craved was to raise my hand and answer it like a normal school boy would.

I just couldn't.

Instead I would sit there within my impenetrable silent bubble I'd found myself in, and daydream of a future where I would become an adult and have a happy life, my stutter non-existent. 

Ten years later I'm an adult with a medicore job, with some great friends of whom I'm very lucky to have. My family, friends, and colleagues all know of my affliction, but as they do not have one themselves, all they see is someone with a mundane speech impediment who needs a little longer to ""get his words out"". 

They, and I assume most people who can speak fluently and articulatory without hindrance don't understand or realise the mental and emotional turmoil it can create.  In this day and age everything is based around communication. Want to apply for a job? Sit down for an hour in front of two people and answer questions on you why you want to spend your free precious time filling up the cheeses on aisle six for pennies.  Need cancel a subscribion? Buy a house? doctors appointment? Give them a ring only to have them hang up when they think that nobody is there because you can't say a simple ""Hello"". 

Or perhaps you want to go to the shops to buy a new coffee machine, when the nice lady walks up to you and asks you if you need any help today, completely unaware of the battle which is raging deep down inside of you. Struggling to breathe, facial contortions, colour shifting from milky white to beetroot red. Being so aware of every millisecond that passes, and just before the words come out finally, you realise that she is looking at you funny, with a hint of fear.

It's degrading. Humiliating. Demasculating. Knowing that I am of sound mind just trying to get by with life, but whenever I need to speak to someone, they think something is wrong in my head and avoid me. I go from the friendly looking chap standing by the toasters to someone they regret walking over to because I ""am not acting normal"". And worse of all? The hardest thing for me to say is ""stutter"". So I can't even tell people what's going on so they never realise.

Every waking hour of my life is dedicated to my stutter. It's always there looming behind every choice I make. It's an invisible disease, eating away at confidence from the inside out until a shallow husk remains; filled only with anxiety with lost dreams and opportunities. If this is to be my life, then it is not worth living. Watching peers around you progress and move up to a better life, when I can't even make a phone call without being hung up on.

Suicide has always been in a different reality to me. Seemed too far away or unrealistic to see it properly. However as time goes on I can only see a very bleak future for me in this life.

1661,"I tried to kill myself the other nightI don't really know how to talk about this. Right now my kids are playing and being cute and the conflict of disgust for myself at my attempt to leave them and the disgust that they deserve someone better than their shit mommy is mingled up. 

I feel sick because I haven't eaten again too. But it doesn't make a difference, I'm still fat. I'm not losing weight. 

My attempt was as pathetic and stupid as I am. I tried to run outside naked in 4 degree snowy weather and throw myself into water. I didn't even make it outside. My husband wrestled me to the ground first while I was screaming like a banshee. The bruises are a reminder of how pathetic I am. 

I've been married for six years. I've been in a poly relationship with my boyfriend for four. Ex boyfriend. Yeah, look at the drama queen having a breakdown over her worthless ex. 

My husband is an INTJ. He loves me deeply but he's terrible at showing it. He's very neurotic. (read the wikipedia article for Neuroticism and you've got his biography). He's also the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac. His upbringing was conservative-Christian-style abusive, and he reacts in a volatile manner to almost everything. I'm ESFJ, I try to keep everyone happy, but I guess I'm shit at it. I rarely clean because I'm always tired. Keeping him calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Keeping myself calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Some days I just can't anymore. Those are the days we fight. 

He loves me, he works very hard for our family. I just feel very lonely and not understood. Or that he even tries to understand. He just wants the fight to stop, but also to ""win"" it. To explain to me with anger-skewed logic how I'm wrong nomatter what, in the heat of a fight. When not in a fight, he still doesn't know how to do things make me happy even though we've been married for six years. Even though I know how to make him happy. I've tried to tell him sweet things to try, he'll do it for a day or two then forget. I feel so lonely. 

At some point I'd started cutting, but rarely. Maybe once every few months, then a year or two between. 

Four years ago my husband had had a girlfriend on Second Life for awhile and I'd been ok with it, our marriage had been rocky and it kept him from harassing me for sex so much. He had encouraged me to talk to guys there too. I met my boyfriend by roleplaying on Second Life, and the connection was instantaneous and intense. We talked for hours and hours and hours the first few days. He understood me, the way he thought made sense. We had the same interests, liked the same games, liked the same themes. My husband was jealous that we had so much in common, but he was getting a lot more sex so he didn't complain much. 

My boyfriend was my social life. I told him everything, though I told him too much so many times its probably what killed it at some point or another. We moved around a lot, so I wasn't able to meet up with him until the very end of those four years. Well after he was already over me, though he always said that he loved me. 

We kept moving, then I got pregnant. He was sure I'd disappear, but I didn't. 

No one would hire me pregnant. I became a stay at home mother before I even had the baby. Childcare would cost the same as me working my ass off at part time jobs just to pay for someone else to raise my children for me. 

My husband hurried and got a job in NYC and we moved to a shitty part of NJ when I was 8 months pregnant. The birth was traumatic for me, the doctors were horrible to me and bullied me into a cesarean I probably didn't need. The new baby was colicky and miserable. My husband's job was hell, the commute was hell. I was alone all day with a miserable baby and my online boyfriend. Then the job cut everyone's already spectacularly low pay down by 25%. We lost our apartment. I had to move in with his control freak hyper conservative christian mother. (borderline fundamentalist) My husband had to move in with a friend for a longer commute, for shit pay, while the new boss they assigned when the old one quit screamed at his three person department in front of the entire office. He had sleep apnea and wasn't sleeping. He was in hell. 

His mother is a hoarder. I was crammed in a tiny basement filled to the ceiling with bullshit and an extreme mold problem that made everyone sick. I had my tiny miserable colicky baby down there while failing at breastfeeding and was in pumping hell. He would cry all night and refuse to eat and I had to be chained to a breast pump. I was supposed to be illustrating a children's book I hated. I eventually finished it but it took months and I still don't like looking at it. Talking to Seth was hell. I needed help and relief and so did he and we had none to give. We would be snappy and miserable at each other. So I stopped talking to him. My boyfriend was the only thing that got me through it. I talked to him a ridiculous amount. I was nocturnal to avoid a large portion of everyone's unending stress, and talked to him while I tried to work. He loved me then, dearly. He got so much attention and we would spend hours and hours talking and roleplaying and just being together. It was unrealistic. 

Then my husband would make the hour long commute to our apartment from work on fridays, then the three hour commute to his parents to get there around 11pm. He would be tired and angry and snappy. He didn't want to look at the baby. We would almost always fight. He was miserable and I was miserable and he was jealous. He didn't have his girlfriend anymore. It was the ugliest time in our relationship. It was the ugliest time in my life, except for now I think. 

Eventually he quit the hell job and we immediately moved in with my parents because living with his was hell on earth. My boyfriend didn't manage well. Suddenly that constant attention was pulled. I couldn't be on calls much at all. I had less childcare and I was severely depressed. My husband jealously tried to keep me away from the computer too, after I had abandoned him for my boyfriend those six months. It was rocky. For awhile my boyfriend railed against it, fought to have me back like we were before. Even if my husband hadn't be jealous, that could never happen. Not without leaving my husband, and through it all I didn't want to. I still loved him. He couldn't ask me to, but I know my boyfriend wished I would. Its a natural selfish thing we all do. I'd been unfair and told him things I shouldn't have, told him when I was hurt and when I was angry with my husband. It wasn't business to share. I'd planted strife between them. 

I'd always held this naive belief that my boyfriend would love me forever. He'd pulled away, gotten a lot more quiet. He didn't respond to everything I said anymore, instead I'd be writing pages to myself. That was around two years in. My husband got a job a new job in Pittsburgh. We moved for the fifth time in the 2.5 years I'd known my boyfriend. We got an apartment. I wanted to fly him up but money was tight from all the moving and we were behind on everything. Also having a 1.5 yr old toddler was tough, and my relationship was still strained with my husband. My boyfriend was around probably out of the same lonliness I was suffering from. We were making plans to meet. 

Then I found out I was pregnant again. A failed IUD that had been put in incorrectly. Who knows if I'd been unprotected for a year or if it had moved somehow, I'll never know. It was dangerous. They tried to get me to abort immediately just to be safe but I refused. I had to be monitored for a month to make sure I wasn't in danger of ectopic pregnancy. Once I was out of danger my boyfriend became cynical and distant. He was sneaking around on Second Life with random people, e-clubs. He still played games with me, and playing some Warhammer roleplaying games with him and friends revived it a bit. I tried to fly him up but became violently ill with morning sickness and he cancelled the flight when I said I couldn't do it. I'm pretty sure that was the moment it was really over. 

The pregnancy was miserable. My husband doesn't do well with small children at all. Baby cries make him panic and respond unreasonably, and he constantly talked about how awful it would be to have a baby and a toddler together. Even though I talked throughout the day every single day, my boyfriend was also distant and uncaring. He'd offhandedly mentioned meeting a girl but her husband had been so jealous it only lasted a couple of days.

I wasn't carrying a baby it seemed, I was carrying a nuclear bomb. It was a long, lonely, miserable pregnancy. I cried so much. When the baby finally came I had to have another cesarean, this time because I'd been sitting in a shitty broken chair for years that screwed up the alignment of my pelvis. It was my fault. 

You can't have a trip with a new baby. You can't have your boyfriend up when your body is shitty and you're breastfeeding. While family is constantly in and out. While my life was hell. At least I'd thought so. I should've just let him in. I'm practical to a fault, but I don't think he was even that interested at that point. We still talked every day. We played games together. I tried to make it through my lonely stressful life. I held onto him, and he was sort of there, but I railed against the distance that was so plain. 

Finally, we made plans. The baby was finally old enough to stay away for a few days. We would get together at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh where we live. My husband's girlfriend would come up to meet him too, a girl he wasn't much into anymore either, but wanted to give a chance. Just weeks before the trip, my boyfriend had a heart attack.

It was the true end, because when he wrote about it on his FA, and that girl from before attached herself to him. He began talking to her constantly, more than me. Roleplaying with her, doing all the things he did with me when our relationship had been new. She was married too. She just didn't have children. 

He talked to her for months. She began posting pictures of their characters fucking. She told me to my e-face that ""it wasn't like that"" and she ""respected my relationship"", meanwhile she wrote all over her tumblr about her new ""boyfriend."" 

I'd postponed the trip to October for him to heal. It was for two weeks. It was pleasant but he was distant, and had issues making love to me. He spent a lot of time on his phone. The second week my husband's girlfriend came up, and there was trick or treat and I took the kids to zoo boo and a hallow/birthday party for my boyfriend and a friend of mine. It was chaotic and my husband had a breakdown because he didn't know how to deal with the jealousy but felt too guilty to leave his girlfriend for long enough to get comfort for me. We had a fight where we had to talk it out. It was awkward. 

The rest of the trip was ok but, the second week was stressful and messy. I'd made a bad choice in timing and by adding the girlfriend. It was too much. 

At Christmas I found out that they were together. She posted pictures of her and her husband and him all nude in their furry forms cuddling together. I got very upset. Then I got dumped. I cried, I was told at first that I had been chosen. The pictures came down. We got each other Christmas gifts. 

Then they all reappeared. And he chose her. I spiraled. It was the worst Christmas of my life. I spent hours on the phone with him. The first few times were sweet and caring. Eventually he couldn't keep the facade up anymore. 

He plastered her on his profile immediately. 

I cut myself. Five stripes to numb the drowning feeling. At some point before then I'd figured out that a clean razor stored in a sterile bottle would cut cleanly enough to give me a dose of adrenaline that would numb an episode of drowning. It wouldn't make me feel good, but it would get my head above water until I just existed in a cold, lonely world instead of drowning in a chaotic whirlpool of hurt. 

I took a break from the computer. Stopped taking commissions and withdrew to try to get through the holiday. I bought a bunch of games on steam and spent a lot of time playing them with my husband. He was happy to ""have me back"" and since I wasn't outwardly being miserable he assumed I was all better. 

A month of back and fourth with my boyfriend, still trying to play games together but his platitudes wearing thin and his promises falling through again and again. Then she posts about how he had visited her. In November. Immediately after seeing me. 

I'd been cheated on in the flesh. 

I found out about a week and a half ago. I called him. I cried a little, but I was mostly numb. He didn't sound very sorry about it. I told him if he wanted me around he would have to talk to me. He said he would. He barely tried. 

I cut again. Four stripes to breathe. 

Then a few days later he leaves to go see her. He's at her house right now. Fucking her. I was stupid, I kept looking at his profile on FA. As long as things weren't being posted maybe it was going badly. Then the flood of blissfully happy images appeared. He knew I was following him, so even if I hadn't been checking, they all flooded my feed. I doubt I even crossed his mind when he did it.

Imagine if someone got a divorce, then a month later when his ex found out she'd been cheated on he starts plastering his facebook with images of him and his new gf together. 

It was the final blow. I've never felt so ugly, so fat, so useless in my life, or so alone. My artwork is constantly surpassed by others and its my own fault for not spending more time on it. The time I do spend is away from my children. My house is a shitpile because I don't clean. 

When he posted all that I went upstairs upset and sad. I was angry and tired. I told him what happened and he scolded me for looking at his profile. I snapped. I told him to say loving words or to shut the fuck up. He didn't like it, he kept shoving his advice down my throat and I got more and more hysterical. I ran downstairs. I've threatened suicide so many times in my hysteria during our echo-chamber fights, he didn't even follow. Then I slammed the silverware drawer and he angrily yelled down at me and ran downstairs. I told him to fuck off. He tore into me verbally, I tore back. We worked each other up until I was done. I was betrayed and heartfucked by one asshole and would be spending a life with the other who would never ever be able to lick my wounds, to actually care. Just fucking correct until I gave in. 

I ran for the door. I was naked. I tried to get it open but he stopped me. I ran for the other. He stopped me again. I ran a third time and got it halfway open, he overpowered me and wrestled me to the floor while I screamed and screamed. He held me down until I gave up. 

I should've gone to the hospital but I didn't. 

He stayed home the next day to make sure I wouldn't do anything. 

I asked my ex to call me, he said he would then he didn't. 

I'm not worth it. I'm not worth bothering with. I'm not worth figuring out what I need because why bother on a fat waste of air.

I'm so. sad. 

Sorry for the life story. It doesn't really tell that my husband is a good person, that my boyfriend was too... He said so many sweet things... but his actions do a lot to prove how false they were. That my kids are smart and beautiful but extremely stressful.

Some days I don't know how to keep going. The house is getting steadily more disgusting. I'm getting snappy at the kids because I want to do nothing but sleep, but I don't get the option. 

Its too hard.",suicide

I'm 21 and without a job because I was convinced by my parents to go to TAFE and get more qualified to go into the industry that I love, but now it has left me over qualified for anything that I apply for and since the tech industry is small in my country... the market is empty. I apply for ANY job and I mean anything, retail, cleaning and janitorial, sales and marketing. Shit I don't even know a thing about just because I want a job so everyone can stop rubbing it in my face and making me the butt of all their jokes even though i'm trying as hard as I can. I'm also told that I can't have an opinion on anything, I tell them that they can save money by shopping at a store we have here called Aldi as apposed to Woolworths and I just literally get told this, verbatim from them ""You can't have an opinion on this subject""... i'm told that I can't give them suggestions because I don't have a family.

i also have some problems with them accepting a phobia I have where I can't leave the house by myself without having a mini panic attack, here is the story of what happened pasted from another thread.
&gt;About 4 years ago, A friend and I were walking home from a coffee shop, We would have been about 16 at the time and I spotted someone that I recognised... It was a person that I had been having dramas with at school and he was running full tilt at me, Luckily for me I was walking past my school at the time and it was open for a play they were putting on. I ran as fast as I can into the school and got a teacher, called my parents to come pick me up.
I should also explain why I was having dramas with this particular person... Myself and his brother(who was in my year) both have hated each other for about 2-3 years before all this happened. One day he stole my phone and I knew where he lives, so we went to his house and got the phone back. I later learned that his mother had sent him to live in another state with his father, because of that and now his brother blames me for it.
Ever since then his brother has hated me and now I have really bad anxiety every time I leave the house. I can't catch the bus home from TAFE because he rides the same bus as me and he gets off after me. We don't live far apart (2 stops) so I get worried that he might get off and hit me. Whenever I talk to my parents about it they just tell me to get over it because ""He probably doesn't care about you anymore"" and call me a pussy and faggot but where I live we have had a recent spat of one punch deaths and it makes me scared to be put in that position where my life could end with one punch and it frightens the hell out of me. So instead of catching the bus straight home (it's not walking distance), I go and see movies and my parents pick me up from the theatre, but they have stopped doing that because it is a minor inconvenience to them. I have told them why I do it, but again they shrug it off.
It's not like I'm depressed though, I would never take my own life and the fear actually is because I don't want to be put in a situation where my life could end, I'm actually a generally happy person... I have some really good friends(Who I haven't told about this because we really don't talk about problems) and I have made some new ones at my TAFE course. I have anxiety and it runs in the family but no-one understands how I feel because mine was caused by something other than just thoughts and it seems like they quite frankly don't care. I don't want to talk it through with him because I don't want to run the risk of reminding him just in case he did forget about me.

So I want to move out but I don't want to live with other people I don't trust. I live off of Centrelink welfare payments while I find a job but it won't be enough for a decent living out of home especially me living in Sydney, one of the most expensive cities in the world.

I don't ever swear around my parents, EVER. I feel it is disrespectful to swear around people but it has driven me today to tell my mum to fuck off and say it multiple times today because of how they make me feel. So that is how serious I feel.

I asked a GP about the anxiety and stuff and she referred me to a psychologist, but it's WAY too expensive and my parents won't help me with the money because they don't give a shit anyway.   

I guess I just want some advice on my current situation and just want to reiterate, I don't have suicidal thoughts, I love life most times. Just when i'm home life drags me down when I'm reminded that i'm useless for wasting my life so far.",suicide

1695,"Don't even care about a throwaway right now...I feel like a 15 year old looking for attention... I feel so stupid.

I don't want to make a ""wall of text"" that everyone seems so hate, even though I am so prone to them. I never shut up about myself, do I?

I have some weird issue, where I get depressed late at night. I can be okay all day and then all of a sudden I'm just down and I don't feel like trying to get out.

I have only cut once. But I've had thoughts of it for years and years. Maybe 5 or 6 years. I actually did a year ago. I was so glad it didn't scar... I fear the scars.

I don't know if I'm the only one who is like this but... I love the way it looks. I fear the scars so sometimes I just scratch myself so I see all the little white lines and feel a bit of pain. Or used to put lipstick on my wrist so it looked like cuts (for about 2 or 3 years before I actually cut, I would do this). Sometimes now I use red sharpie. Most of the time I find a razor or knife and just look at it... telling myself, ""just fucking do it."" But then I fear scars and don't. 

I even want to do it when I'm happy. I just like the way it looks! I want to look down and see it... but not the scars, they have to be fresh. I don't want the scars in case this feeling one day passes, or someone sees...

I think about killing myself. I think I'm just sucking the world of it's resources and giving nothing back. I have no job, little friends, and I almost have no where to live. In 15 days if I can't come up with the money, I will be homeless.

I am only living on my own because my mom is crazy too. I had to leave, even though I knew I couldn't afford it. I lost all my jobs over my depression. Everyone can see it. I lost boyfriends and friends, too.

I have a boyfriend now, he broke up with me once over my depression, and that I was still in love with someone else. I tried to prove to him that I was getting better, and now hide my depression better. Fake smiles are becoming easier. He believes in me again.

As for the other that I love... I wish he was just a bit different. Then we would be okay. But he demands sex and lacks any sympathy or empathy. The only reason I'm not homeless today is because he helped me out... but wasn't nice about it. Just gave it to my roommate, didn't talk to me. 

I wish we could've been just friends. At LEAST.
see: crappy and depressing pop song about lost love - Katy Perry

This is getting long isn't it? Just a couple more points...

Back to I Feel Stupid. I pride myself on being smart but I feel belittled by people almost daily. I don't know how to cook. I can't keep a job. I'm a picky eater. I'm shy. OH am I shy. I have some social anxiety. I sit in the corner alone at parties unless I'm drunk/high. I know what they're all thinking, ""What's wrong with her?"" And that makes me even more anti-social. I fear the people.

""Why don't you help me cook?"" ""Why don't you initiate sex?"" ""Why don't you clean something without someone asking you to?"" ""Why don't you know how to do _____?"" ""Why won't you try this food?"" ""Why can't you make a decision?""
I feel like I curl up into a shell when I hear these things. And then it gets worse... ""Why are you all quiet and depressed now?""

I don't want to be mean to my boyfriend but earlier I clicked a Reddit link that turned out to be a ""screamer"" gif. So I screamed. He was resting in bed, like usual, and he yells, ""What the fuck! Fuck you! What was that for?!"" I laughed about it and said sorry, but he didn't laugh. I tried to make light of the situation but he was just angry at me for screaming. Thus started my late night depression. I was just fine before that.

I just don't like when people are mad at me. I just want to make people happy. That's all I want to do with my life.

Okay so:
**TL;DR** - I like cutting but fear scars, I'm crazy shy and it makes people not like me, I think of suicide but fear death, I constantly feel stupid and inadequate and instead of doing something about it, I usually hide in a shell and become worse.

I tried to hang myself but the pain of asphyxiation was more than I could handle sober. I wish I had a quicker way out.

I was just laid off from the only job I've had for 8 years. The room mates I've been incredibly close with and lived with for 5 years are done with me.

My parents who are lifelong alcoholics have been admitted into rehab, and I no longer have any relationship with them. I have no drive to look for apartments, or a job, and I just want everything to be over. I'm a failure in every aspect of life, I've squandered so many opportunities. I have no money to my name, and no potential in life. I want the pain to end. I want it all to just go away. I've been told so many times that things get better, when the hell does that start?

1710,"sorry - 12/9/19 - 9:53 pm to 10:28 pmsome 18+ mentions up ahead.

as the decade comes to an end, i realize now that my life has always been messed up. not as bad as others, but i'm not strong enough for it to seem as small as it really is. if i kill myself at any point in time, please read this and you'll know why.

before i start, let me say, i'm struggling with gender identity as i'm typing this so let's just say i'm young and non-binary, born female.

\--------

when i was born, i had and have multiple sicknesses. none are really visible, and i'm not sure exactly what they are, but i have a very distinct scar on my lower stomach. 

from ages 1-4 i lived with my grandmother, my mom, my dad, and my uncle. my uncle was and is severely depressed, and just started abusing drugs at this point. i don't remember much from this time in my life, but it was mostly happy. he made a video/movie about his life and i was in it. there was alot of violence and i remember that in the film, my mother was being chased by a man with a gun. i've had a fear of my mother being killed ever since then.

from ages 5-9 i moved to a new house with my parents, but i visited my grandmother frequently and her house was kind of like a safe place to me. around age 6 or 7, the same man who chased my mother with a gun in the film (he was a friend of ours) came to our house, drunk, and assaulted both of my parents with either a pistol or a bat (can't remember). my step brother sexually assaulted me multiple times, and my grandmother had to sell her house. my uncle attempted to kill himself by ODing on drugs in our bathtub. some guy my age at the time touched me in places that i wished he didn't.

ages 10-11, i started feeling depressed and thought about self harm. came out to my parents as pansexual by having a breakdown in front of them. i started having frequent visits with a school counselor. another guy my age kept calling me things like ""his sex toy"" or ""slut"" and he'd always tell me about an nsfw dream he had about me, him, and another guy.

age 12 up until now. started cutting, lying to my parents, getting into toxic relationships. was manipulated into being in a relationship with some girl i didn't like. was sent to therapy. drove/hiked through an EF1 tornado, one of my best friends passed away, my step-brother was kicked out of the house and i've only seen him once since then. my boyfriend, who was the only person i trusted at the time, ghosted and cheated on me, my friend calls me every night saying she's going to hurt or kill herself, and i almost committed suicide.",suicide

When I think about the purpose of my existence, I only found the lack of itself. I'm not trying to find money, possessions, luxury, expesive things, nor status; the only thing I try to find is a meaning. But I found out I'm just a useless number.

I only ever cared about the truth, the balance, the understanding, being balanced. But I failed, I failed miserably, while the rest of the ones around me did not, they failed but raised or found another way to keep their living pulse going.

I'm such a fucking loser, such a fucking idiot, such a fucking stupid. The only reason I would kill myself is because of how much disgusting I'm to myself, I can't tolerate such a stupid creature like myself will ever life. Among my surrouding people, which includes my own self, the only one who deserves being murdered is yes, me, fucking disgusting piece of shit.

I still can't understand how people would ever love me. STOP LOVING ME, YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON I KEEP LIVING FOR. I WANT YOU ALL TO SEE THE DISGUSTING PIECE OF SHIT I AM. OPEN YOUR EYES, AND YOU'LL HATE ME ALMOST AS MUCH AS I HATE MYSELF.",suicide

I was really cheerful and funny, kind of like the class clown, but when I got home I used to cut my thighs and cry all night. That faded away when I was in grade 11. Cause I simpler didn't even have time to be sad. My immigrant father was expecting good grades and I had to deliver.  I studied really hard in my last yr to get into uni. Problem is I picked the wrong thing. I picked architecture, I don't even know why I picked it. the only reason is reputation. I wanted my parents to be able to brag. My brother and sister are going to study medicine when they graduate. And me.. I had no idea and when I told my parents that they told me to shutup and get a grip. For fear of disappointment, I picked something that sounded great, and something that I thought would appeal to me,being the creative type. Boy was I wrong. I hated it. The first week I knew this is not what I wanted to do with my life. But I had another class I liked that made me realise I would enjoy a different course. I thought oh hey no biggie, I can just transfer right? ... wrong. I told my parents that I was thinking of transfrrring and they almost fucking killed me. They said I was quitting. That I was lazy. That I was giving up. I said okay fair enough it's only been half a year I'll give it another go. I ended up failing every single one of my classes in my first year. I was so sad I couldn't sleep. I was always afraid to tell my parents about my depression, so I never got help. It was so bad I would get jitters and I would uncontrollably cry. I wanted to cut again but I didn't even have the energy for that. I could t tell them I'd failed because I'd probably be thrown out of the house.  My dad legit said either study architecture or get out of uni. My parents are middle eastern and so they're very strict. Especially my dad. I get that they want the best for me but yeah. It's tough. So at the end of first year I asked if I could transfer again, they said no. I was put on restriction at uni for failing so much. And I could only do it part time. I pretended I was going to uni on days I didn't have it so my parents wouldn't notice.  I failed one class and passed 3, which weren't architecture subjects but were things related to the course I wanted to be in. Now, I'm at the end of my second year in this stupid course. Wasting money each day with something I don't have the talent for. It eats me up inside knowing I have taken someone who is passionate about this fields place. It kills me. I'm so sad I can't even smile anymore. I get yelled at by everyone all the time. My whole family puts me down everyday not only because I don't smile and I'm pretty mean to people now, but also because I'm overweight. Just last week my mother told me I was everything she hates in a person. Sometimes I cry so much my tears don't even come out anymore. I just want to be loved and supported. I have so much pressure on my shoulders and no one understands how bad I want to end it all. I'm a coward. I'm scared of death yet I pray every day for it to come. I feel like I'm dying slowly.

I have an appointment with my psychologist set up for tonight, the only person who knows about this, but that feels so far away from right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Suicide is weird. Some days I'm overwhelmed with the need to murder myself, other days I just need it to end and want to die. I never realized before that there is a huge difference between wanting your pain to stop by any means, and wanting to murder yourself. It keeps going back and forth and gets all mixed up, I think I'm losing my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

Even typing this feels like trying to walk through a wall of rushing water. I just need it to end. It has to end. I can't hold on any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote the stuff below when my mind was more sound. Feels relevant.

&amp;nbsp;

NO ONE KNOWS how awful I'm doing because I can't talk about it without risking my relationships/job/etc. So instead I lie and just say I'm sick, the kind of sick that they understand, and sometimes I even start to believe it. I would way rather be sick, sick is simple. People get that sick people can't do everything healthy people can. I hate not being able to convincingly tell people that I can't handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Like, if I have a migraine, I can just say ""sorry I have a migraine :("" and that's it, no questions asked. Don't get me wrong, I've had lots of migraines, and they are awful, I wouldn't wish them on anyone, but I would still take chronic migraines over this any day.

&amp;nbsp;

If I have a migraine, people don't get mad and confused and expect me to explain further, or think I'm up to something or being passive aggressive or snotty. ""I just can't go. Wish I could, but I have a migraine."" Simple as that.

&amp;nbsp;

People feel compassionate and understand your pain when you have migraines. They bring you food and worry about you and hope you feel better soon. I wish there was something I could say that would incite that level of understanding with people when I'm having a bad day because of mental health reasons.

&amp;nbsp;

With this, at best they get uncomfortable and quiet. More likely they get confused and put off and start to distance themselves from you unless you make it up to them somehow. You owe them if you unload this shit on them.

So I'm in grad school and it really sucks. I'm really not into the idea of going into academia, but I don't want to quit, I love my discipline and, let's be real, I have nothing else going for me. That said, I can't stand my peers or the faculty, I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further, given the cost.
I got into a language program that would be great for my CV, but financially speaking, I just can't afford to support myself through the summer. Outside of loans I'm on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left. I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don't do this, I will not get my degree. My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning.
I have no clue what to do. I don't want to give up my degree, but I really, really HATE my program. If I stay, I'll be miserable, if I go, I'll hate myself for quitting. I know what your thinking, but transferring in grad school is easier said than done. 
Last night, I got into a really big argument with my parents. It wasn't so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself. A few hours later, after I got done studying, I was really upset.  I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it. So, I took my belt off, fastened it around my neck, tied it to a rack in my closet, not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there. I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head, but either I didn't think it would work or I chickened out. I don't really know which it was. I took it off and just went to bed.
So, I guess my question is, did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it? I don't want my parents to worry about me/I don't want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation. But, I also don't think  this is something I should brush under the rug.",suicide

So I‚Äôll probably fail this course no surprise I don‚Äôt really have the personal aptitude for university or this career path but then what sure failing university isn‚Äôt the end of the world but I think it should be at least for me. The thought of existence without purpose drives me crazy if I fail what am I supposed to do? Go find some shitty as job so I can pay bills to live a mundane existence alone? Why fucking bother I‚Äôd rather just go kill myself and if it comes that point I think I might actually have the balls to pull it off.

1803,"Most days my brain is just silently AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIt's like this indescribable emotional pain mixed with an intense, almost overwhelming desire for life to end all resulting in a feeling as if there's a corner of my brain just screaming endlessly.

**TL;DR** **Shoutout to everyone here trying to get on with life with a brain that wants to die**

Posting here because I can't act anymore. I can't pretend that everything is okay. I've gained 6kg in a week from eating rubbish which is super yuck, but I also don't care because my brain has been swamped by intense suicidal ideation and if I'm not sufficiently distracted the thoughts about suicide come back in like BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM just drowning out everything else. 

I think about self harming a lot. I mean, not only suicide but other forms of physical pain. But then I remember I've got way too many scars already and additional scars and a high pain tolerance doesn't change anything.

I don't have a good reason to want to die. There's no major crisis. The relationship breakdown was over 4 months ago and I'm mostly over that. I have enough money for everything I essentially need. Sure, I'll probably need several more major operations because genetics suck, and I'll definitely need a double mastectomy at some point because cancer risk,  but that's not it either. It's not even the fact that I have about three friends, and the last time I hung out with a friend was in February - because,  at the moment.people are too exhausting for me to want to have any interaction with. I don't want anything to do with anyone right now. I can't pretend to not be depressed when I'm around other people anymore. It takes all of my energy to pretend to be normal and smile and laugh at work, and I know I don't do a very good job at that as it is. 

It's not really any of that. I just don't care anymore. About any of it. Any of life. I am amazed I have been together enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth and pay bills and work 3 days a week. Do look pale and run down as shit though. Going through the motions, I guess, while my brain is screaming I want to die all the while. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm thinking about suicide all day, every day. I suspect it's the general anaesthetic I had from a colonoscopy in May sending me off the deep end into post-operative depression, but also the general state of the world. 

Now, I know if I stopped eating crap and did more exercise and got more sunshine and made more of an effort to be social I'd probably feel better. But it also gets to a point where you cannot bring yourself to do any of that, because just getting dressed and maintaining basic personal hygiene is a mammoth achievement. So, I am going to my GP on Monday to ask to go back on antidepressants. It might be a complete waste of time and money, as it has been in the past, but I can't help hoping that this time will be different, that this time maybe we'll try a different drug that might actually give me the capacity to overcome the intrusive suicidal thoughts and do the exercise and the things I know I need to do for wellbeing.

Also going to see the psychologist on Monday. It's been difficult to get an appointment (a) because it's bloody expensive and (b) because a huge chunk of the general population are under huge stresses so she's super busy and hard to get into. I'm hoping I have the money to continue to see her because she's the best psychologist I have ever seen. I haven't kept it up because of financial stress, and my mental health has suffered as a result. But I think this time I should be able to stick with it for a while.

It's been hard because the depression has screwed with my cognitive function and sleep again too. I can't concentrate for more than 2 seconds. I'm agitated and drowning in anxiety all the time. I go to sleep late and wake up early whether I like it or not. I can't remember anything and everything takes me ten times longer to process or understand than usual, and I constantly feel as dumb as a rock. 

I wasn't entirely honest with my doctor last time I went because I didn't want to be on antidepressants again, and I sure as hell didn't want to run the risk of being put in a mental hospital again. But at the moment it's gotten to the point where I just don't care about anything anymore, so might as well be totally upfront.

I think I'm too lazy to actually kill myself. Having been there and tried that more than once, getting it right takes a lot of planning and organising and logistics I just don't have the energy for. Especially because were I to go through with one of the plans for suicide I have, I don't want to leave all my stuff just around for my family to deal with. I'd need to sort out my belongings and affairs etc etc etc and make sure I had enough money to cover any potential funeral or medical expenses if I fucked it up.

And that's the nub of it. Human beings are both incredibly resilient and incredibly fragile creatures. I think what keeps me going at times like these is that I know if I failed suicide where I was left half brain dead and still aware, that that would be a fate far worse than this. My life could be 100,000x worse than it currently is, no doubt. But knowing that doesn't change that incessant suicidal impulse blamming it's way across my brain.

I just wanted to put this out there because I needed to tell someone how I feel right now with completely honesty. And maybe someone else will resonate with how I feel right now and it might help them feel they're not alone.",suicide

1837,"I don't know how to carry on right nowIm 29, living in the UK.

A small background of my health conditions, just to give some context:
- bipolar disorder type 2
- severe anxiety
- obsessive compulsive disorder (which I'll explain a little)
- emotionally unstable personality disorder
- hyper mobility syndrome
- ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)

My diagnoses mean that I really don't and cannot function normally. I did for so long, forcing everything into a bulging box, taping it shut and hiding it under the bed. 

Then I got made redundant from a job that I enjoyed and was good at. Very good at. It was a call centre admittedly, but I really enjoyed it. I made some brilliant friends, including someone that ended up being my best man and I really do consider him a very good friend. Through him, I have met other friends, plus someone who understands the shit that I am going through.

I ended up having to take a job that sucked. A lot. It was the beginning of the opening of that box. It was slowly being pulled out from under the bed. I was treated like shit. I had no sick pay, so when I needed the time off when I was having a bad MH day, I was financially fucked. I was working full time, looking after my wife and we struggled a lot. Not as bad as some, but my god it was hard. The job was complicated and my MH (which we later worked out was my ADHD) just compounded matters greatly.

I ended up getting another job! HUZZAH! It was in insurance which is something that I had done at my old job. Private office. Nice little family run business. Annnnnnnnnnnd that's where we hit the snag. I wasn't very good. I wasn't expecting myself to hit the floor running, but I hit the floor. Hard. 

I wasn't worried though, I thought that I would be at least given training. Which I really wasn't. In anyway. But, I soldiered on for four days, getting up a lot earlier than I normally would have, mental health be damned. The pay was so much better, no shift work and I could get a bus all the way home, meaning that no busy town, no social interactions, just iPod and a quiet journey home. 

Then, four days in, the recruitment agency that contacted me initially called. I was on the bus, leaving town as I had to collect a parcel from one of those amazon thingies, as I live in a flat and my wife's mobility isn't great, and this was a iPhone, so I wanted a secure place for it to go. I updated my facebook status ""New job, new me, new beginnings. Let's do this and let's get life back to what it should be! - feeling positive.""

I got on the bus and my phone rang. It was the recruiter and they had some concerns about my working there. The owner wasn't happy that I was asking questions and that I wasn't as good as they expected. Don't bother going back. My heart stopped, and I just didn't know what to do. I started to cry, but realised as a grown man, I had to hold it together on the bus. I started to catastrophise, terrified I was going to lose my house, my bills weren't going to get paid etc etc. Then there was my wife?! What was I supposed to do?

I got home and tried to be pragmatic, I applied for disability, I couldn't cope with the prospect of looking for a job in anyway as I knew the box had been ripped open and all manners of hell had been unleashed. Pandora had walked off with the proverbial butterfly that signified hope. She had walked off, crushing it in her palm. 

Disability came through and I was ok for a little bit, I ended up in hospital after an attempt, but I was getting better, day by day. I applied for college, am doing ok ish on my course. 

I subsequently got diagnosed with ADHD, and HMS shortly after, and I am struggling, but I am finding that some days I am falling under the water and cannot cope. I am inflicting a lot of this on my wife, being verbally abusive and quite frankly a total c*nt. 

I have been physically abusive to her in the past which I am in NO WAY proud of. If I had my way before, I would not be posting this and someone would have been scraping my remains off the ground floor of a 18 story drop. 

This brings us to now. (sorry if it seems a little patchy, I just wanted to give a little context). My OCD is at the point where I cannot stand waking up, I struggle with even little things not working, just the slightest imperfection in something and it must be rectified there and then. It also has left me having to constantly check that I have everything. Many times. It leads to me being late for things and panicking like a bitch when I cannot find something. My memory tends to feed the compulsions. I skin pick, I cut at spots, scars, anything that I deem unnecessary. 

This was made very apparent to the disability assessor, when I tried to explain things and just couldn't. I was left in such a state after that assessment meeting. I am so grateful for the person I saw for being so caring and understanding. 

I have found that very little keeps me going at the moment. I am trying so hard, but cannot cope. My HMS leads me to sometimes needing a walking stick. It's embarrassing. I want to end everything and just make this constant sensation of failure and hell end. 

I have a wife. I have an aunt with two little boys that think the world of me. I have two best friends again with little ones that do the same. I cannot forgive myself for thinking like this. But equally I cannot cope with the way my brain is working. 

I don't know what the future will hold.

I don't know what to do beyond hiding in my room with my laptop and my iPod trying to simulatenously distract myself from myself and hide myself from everything else.

After an extensive analysis of the pros/cons of living I decided to put it an end, as a matter of fact while I write this I'm smoking a ""poisoned cigarette"".

My reasons? I have no future, I fucked up two Careers because I'm just not interested. When I dropped the first one I had the chance to study a new thing in the same university, but I recently screwed that too. I don't know, I'm just lazy, I prefer playing PC games even through I know is wrong, I just can't help it and it's killing me... Basically wasted my parents money and they will be very dissapointed.

I know they love me, I love them and I'm sorry they'll have to suffer my death. But I just can't stand it, here in my country without a degree you'll never win over 400 dollars/month (half the money to survive).

I‚Äôm no closer to success today than I was 20 years ago and I‚Äôm not going to spend the rest of my life hoping and praying and visualizing that a life that is tolerable will somehow magically happen to me. It‚Äôs become painfully clear that visualization is bullshit. I am so tired of struggling. Always having nothing. I‚Äôve been in debt literally my entire adult life. Even with two bankruptcies I can‚Äôt seem to get my shit together. Every time I try something new to dig my way out it goes to hell. Constant repeated failure really is no longer acceptable to me. I will no longer live with debt that cannot be erased regardless of what I do to try - I‚Äôm so tired of the overwhelming stress that comes with that - It‚Äôs been literally my entire fucking life. I don‚Äôt remember a time that I wasn‚Äôt in debt and I don‚Äôt remember a time that I haven‚Äôt been stressed about finances. It seems as though that the universe has decided, without me, that I am not allowed to be successful financially because literally nothing works out for me regardless how much I want it or how hard I try for it.  
About a year ago I had what I would call a spiritual awakening. A realization that we are all connected and that our consciousness is eternal but our time here on earth is only temporary. I believe we choose our lives before we get here and everybody has a mission that is spelled out before we‚Äôre born. The bonds we create on earth are actually created long before we‚Äôre ever even conceived. We all have a pre-destine mission in life and the universe will push us in a the direction we need to go but we are given free will in order to achieve your life mission. I‚Äôve had a lot of amazing opportunities in my life, many of which I have completely fucked up beyond what I can ever recover from. I‚Äôve done stupid things, said stupid things and I‚Äôve hurt people that I was supposed to walk this life with. It‚Äôs unfortunate because I know I could have achieved great things with the right partner and proper support. I just got tired of waiting and too proud to ask for more help at this point. 
Time for a reset. 
Please also know that there is absolutely nothing that anybody close to me could‚Äôve done to prevent this - literally nothing - so you have absolutely no reason to feel bad or have any thought of ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve or could‚Äôve or would‚Äôve‚Äù done something had I only known how bad he was.

1887,"I am not sure what I expect out of sharing this.
  Anytime I have reached out in a moment of deep despair to our community through the various subs all the beautiful people rush forward and try to help which I appreciate immensely.  However, even if I am alleviated of the pain of my existential issues, the issues themselves remain.  So I have found myself in a moment with less emotional intensity and may be better equipped to rationally examine this.  I have been VERY careful not to discuss this with most people because I fear disrupting their foundation upon which all the good things rest (ideals, dreams, goals...etc).  If I am to progress past this low point in my life, I absolutely need to approach the issue from all angles here.  I am not great with structuring these things sometimes, so please forgive me.

  Of all the lingering elements from my past that still bother me, the foremost amongst these is my endless source of **self-loathing** and my issues being invested in this world, in this life.  While discovering I was trans finally gave me what I needed for decades, the knowledge of what I am, everyone is aware that 'it can get worse before it gets better'.  I rode most of these waves rather well, I believe, considering all that has to be unpacked, disposed off and the healing that must occur.  But I think these two things I mentioned keep coming back to bother me.  

  How can I stop hating myself (if I even should!)?  I have felt this and fed this since middle school, about twenty years ago.  While life has occasionally distracted me from this omnipresent fact, this is part of the poison that seeps into the well.  I have tried creating positive feedback loops with proper self-talk and productivity, revising my mental narrative and outright ignoring those thoughts and feelings and focusing elsewhere.  I have seen therapists and I am familiar with their tools.  But this is DEEP and implacable.

  Next, as with many of us on this path, I managed to **survive by escaping** this world.  For me that meant graphic novels, standard novels, gaming and eventually substances.  Some people think I am strong, but I only managed to endure by being mindful of putting one foot in front of the other while dreaming of other worlds, of another life.  Now, even when I try, I struggle to engage with this life.  And by that I mean to really feel invested, to DESIRE to work on something and improve something, to have the hope of any success.  I have always felt like I have been a person that just 'was not there'.  

(Warning for others that are older, harsh thoughts for my age ahead)

All of this is exacerbated by getting older.  Its a feeling like waking up from a coma in a house that is literally falling apart around me.  Having to struggle to get my life on track fighting with the momentum it has taken on and maintaining (without any hope of actually improving really) my body and appearance is just devastating.  I was better of not caring at all.  Who is out there for me?  What is there at all at this point?  Acceptance?  Surrender?  Just making it through and surviving?  Those sound like compensation prizes, like an achievement worth little to no value.  I have focused on goals, ran upon the hedonic treadmill, and behind every thought is...**why?**  My moment basking in the warmth of my trans epiphany has faded, and I am left with the harsh reality of picking up whatever pieces I can find and seeing their value.  And for me, I see none.  

I am weak, I am afraid, and I am a burden to my family and friends.  I have broken hearts when I was lost and made so many mistakes.  I just want rest, please....I just want to not be me anymore.  I do not think kind sentiments will do much anymore.

1889,"Difficult thoughtsSo, I'm in one of my crisis and just came across here while trying to find something to get my mind off of everything. So I guess I'll just post away and hopes it helps a bit.  


So, I had a friend. She commited suicide in 2012, and I got to know only in 2013. I was in my last year of high school when I discovered, and I had a fight with her. Stupid reasons, really. Mostly not agreeing on stuff that really wasn't important. When I tried to talk to her again to apologize, or something, I got the news. It was heartbreaking, and I wish I could have done something, anything. I mean, we were both pretty alone at... life really. And just like that, a person that was one of my only friends was gone, just like that. Nothing I could feel other than the pain it left, that I could never talk to her again. That all I have now is fucking memories.  


So, you'd think, due to my experience, that I'd learn something. I don't know. But even all those years later I just did not forgive myself. I'm not particularly alone, and I KNOW there are people that care. That they are with me, and all that. Still, even when people say that I'm worth it or whatever, I can't seem to believe it. All that comes through my mind is how much I fucked everything up for basically nothing, and how nothing I could ever do would revert that. It's so stupid, but yet, every once in a while, it becomes so heavy and I just don't know what to do. I think that I'm not worth it. That it'd be better if everything came to a stop. But yet, I do believe in the words of the few people that say they care, no matter how hollow they seem when I think about it. Basically, yeah, I don't know. Honestly, I just feel like utter shit, and usually I tank this shit alone, as I've always did. And I see where it takes me. I just wait and see, like the stupid coward I am.  


Anyway, I'm sorry about this. I'm not sure it all made sense, but this is how I'm feeling. this is how I usually feel when late night comes around and I can't just so something to make it go away. Anyway, I'm sorry if this bothered anyone. I just needed to let this out in a different place, in a place where I don't have the certainty people will just say that I should ""let it go"" already.

i've been a drunk for 3 years. i haven't worked, i've done nothing. my sister got pregnant and had to move back home, my dads wife left him, we're all broke. my sister doesn't want me around either. i went over there tonight and she called the cops, (second time in a week). they told me to leave or they'd arrest me. on my way out they pulled me over and gave me a $180 ticket for not fully stopping at a stop sign. I can't pay that either.

I try to talk to my dad, he says he doesn't care anymore, he wants to kill himself too. he's facing eviction. he's had it with me and my siblings. My sister encouraged me to kill myself. 

my entire family is against me. I don't have a friend in the world. I don't know what to do. 


arent I entitled to happiness? isn't everyone? why did my life turn out like this? how the fuck did this happen?

I can't live like this. I've got 2 days to make a decision and it's not looking good. I'm not going to be homeless. I'll be dead before that happens.",suicide

Actually, that's not true. My life is great compared to a lot of people; my family rocks, I have (a decent amount) of money, I'm in college, and good friends. But there is one thing that has been missing from my life; a relationship. I'm basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl. I'm 20 now, and it's awkward to admit. I have a girl I kind of like who I work with, but she's from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopes.

I really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am, but I don't want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist. They have enough worries without worrying about me. I know they would give me all the help in the world, but I just can't bring myself to telling them about it. Every time my Mom randomly asks ""Are you O.K?"", I think for a second to say no and tell her everything. But instead I smile, say ""Of course Mom!"", and move on with my life.

This isn‚Äôt a new question, it‚Äôs been haunting me for about 6 years and I don‚Äôt know how to get any drive back, nor has my life improved. The coffee doesn‚Äôt help nor does the medicine.

I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and they‚Äôre necessary skills/trades. But why bother with it when your suicidal, the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily.

I‚Äôm just taking a random course to begin with so I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm even going to uni, probably to just meet expectations.

It‚Äôs not that I have no one. I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know it‚Äôs a privilege. But I just can‚Äôt seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes.

1954,"Concerned for a friend, our conversation has left me shaken up.I want to start from the beginning, I apologize early on if the information is not needed. I will try to get to our conversation that just happened a few minutes ago quickly. Sorry if the formatting and paragraphing is weird. 


I play online video games quite a lot. This has led me to meet plenty of people who come in and out of my life a lot. Except for one of my friends who we will call James. We have talked and played together for a little over a year now. This has caused a pretty good relationship to grow between us. We text/call each other and even video chat on the occasion. James is 19 and lives in another state than I. 


Because we have grown so close we talk a lot about things that happen in real life and about our pasts. He mentioned to me that he has attempted suicide before, but was saved, and generally during our relationship he was never depressed or has ever shown any signs that he is still feeling like killing himself. 


It all started a about 6 months ago, when he got together with this woman, they dated for a few weeks and he made her pretty happy. He often makes the mistake of falling to quickly and deeply in love. When they broke up he was very depressed, the only time we would ever talk was when he was completely intoxicated. We went through a period where he would never answer calls or texts from me even. Finally, some good things happened in his life that brought him up and we were talking again. 


Just 2 weeks ago, he decided to try dating again. He met a girl via a dating app. They talked non stop, which made him smile and laugh and REALLY made a difference in him that even I could see from a few states away. They met each other in person as she only lived an hour away from him and everything was going great. He was talking about how much he loved her (I don't know if he told her that) and how she could be the one he marries. I didn't want to ruin his fun, as it was nice to see him happy, so I did not say anything to him about how soon it was to make statements like that. 


They broke up yesterday. He had text me very early in the morning when I was sleeping and I didn't get the text for another hours. All it said was ""I need someone right now"". I felt terrible because somehow I knew what happened. I gave him a call, no answer. I text him, no answer, so I called him again and he answered, saying he was at a friends getting drunk. I asked if he was okay, and he explained to me what happened. They broke up because ""her mom told her she didn't want them to be together"". He pretty much hung up on me, so I decided to give him space, as he clearly didn't want to talk about it. 


Today, when I asked him if he wanted to play any games (I didn't want to bug him about what happened). He said he would, so we got on and played for about 20 minutes before he left to go play a different game. After a few hours he called and sounded extremely intoxicated. He asked to play, so I hopped on the game and joined him. I asked him if he was drunk, he said he was. I could tell. 


This is where it gets to our conversation I asked why he was drinking so much, he explained that he has felt like he was having a heart attack all day and yesterday. He was slurring his speech, making incoherent sentences, etc. Then he (very casually) says he wants to ""blow his brains out"". It took me by surprise and I asked him why. He says he was in pain, saying that he wants to end it so he no longer feels how he is anymore. I got more and more concerned as he spoke. I had no idea what to say. I know for a fact that he has the means and intent to do something like that, so I asked him if he was serious, why he was going to do it. He said he was serious and said he wanted to end his pain and that he didn't deserve to live anymore. 


I tried to tell him that I care about him and that I would miss him, his family and friends would, etc. Anything I could think of to say to him. He just shot everything down, saying he hates everyone and that his family and friends (including me) could ""fuck off and go to hell"" because he will be dead and won't have to deal with the consequences of his death. I pretty much was left crying my eyes out, left not knowing what to say. All I could say was ""your life matters to me, and I would be upset if you died"". After repeatedly saying he didn't care, he finally says ""do you think if I was actually going to kill myself I would be sitting here talking to you? No i wouldn't be"". 


He basically started to lash out against me, and I had nothing left to say. He had shrugged off anything I could think of to say. Right now, I am heading off to work and said he could call me and I would talk to him if he needed or wanted to talk. He didn't respond and just logged off of the game. Hasn't answered my texts or calls. It's not my fault I have to go to work and can't listen to him calling me a whore for the rest of the night. But I did offer to listen while I was at work. 


I honestly have no idea what to do anymore. I'm not sure how serious his threats were, and I have no idea where he lives, no contact other than his cell phone number. I don't know if I should reach out to his family members on Facebook or if that would cause more damage. ",suicide

I realize I'm not the only one who has had a shitty life, but it's about time I think about what I want. I can't even describe, or begin to tell you ladies and gentlemen the trauma and violence I've had to put up in the past and my current status is no better. Maybe not as violent? But the memories are still there and my life was ruined way before making this thread. I had a dream before making this thread. I would like to share with each individual's undivided attention. As I said before I've been through a lot of trauma. I have been through heart aches, violence, plenty lives have fell victim in my life and resulted into me watching death do it's part. I even was one of those victims or could've been after attempting my very 1st suicide and it resulted in me being pronounced dead for 5 minutes and that's being aided by medical personnel. I'm no war veteran or anything. I simply had possibly the worse luck in this game we play called life and it's like playing chess except I was the pawn, but that's just it? I was stuck being the pawn no matter how hard I tried to do the absolute necessary to change my life for the better and it failed miserably over and over and keep in mind? I was doing this all myself. I never had a shoulder to lean on or someone to be my side and say ""I love you and everything will be alright"". I don't have anyone to talk to and no one thinks I'm worthy enough of their time and never take me serious. Anyways sorry for going off topic, but this dream I had was a beautiful thing. At least in my eyes. That I was laying terminally ill in my bed in a dark room with a light shining down on me. Keep in mind I am not terminally ill, nor am I mocking those that are. In fact if you want my opinion? I rather take every disease someone has and pass it down to me because there are good people in this world that don't deserve to lose their lives. I know what to expect now. Someone will say "" well neither do you"" or ""what makes you so different from the rest of us""? Well forgive me for the only thing I can feel is my own suffering and hurting and not someone else's so of course I'm going to feel like I'm the only one at this moment with nothing to lose in which I don't and with the most pain. Life will be better without me and some will not understand me? And some might and even if you do show care? It's not genuine. Anyways I am sitting here playing with a loaded firearm I recently ripped off and stole. I know some will say "" we can't stop you "" nor do I expect anyone to, but you can say your worse to me and it has got to the point where if I were to recover from this? I'll just use all the hurtful things said to me as left over motivation to lead me back in the position I am right now. Take care to all of you and thank you for letting me say my final peace.

We chose to sing under our spell from the mlp rainbow rocks movie (btw them girls watching them back have a weird tension about them), I was originally a backup singer but main girl couldn't handle the role so I took it and I sung my little heart out and we got to the finals but we lost to someone singing a Bruno mars song or something idk. I was sad we lost because I was 8 and I really just sung in front of hella people only to loose. ( didn't matter to me because the prize was a tennis racket and a ball from Poundland) oh well, now I've remembered this I have a massive flex on people because I went and did that. What a power move. 8 year old me was a mythic person 10/10 would do again. Tl;dr, Sung mlp song at school talent show, gigachad move, didn't win.",non-suicide

I'm so fucking tired of everyone, I want someone to really listen and understand how hurting I really am everyday, sure maybe it's not the worst every single day but it doesn't take a scientist to understand that somethings wrong with me. I'm always struggling and it feels like it'll never end, how will I ever become the person I wanna be when I don't even know what that looks like. I am hopeless, a disappointment and a failure. I try to open up to people I know, only person I'm really open with is my girlfriend but she doesn't understand how hurt I am, I love her so much. She's my only friend and only person who doesn't dismiss me, but we've fought so much lately, I thought we were past all this but it's come back. I simply just wanna die, it's like I've been in this situation far to much this year. Too be honest I'm to much of a coward, hell even my girlfriend said that I'm a coward for not being open with my parents about how I struggle. There's a lot a struggle with but it'd take forever to do it all. I just want someone to understand, I'm sorry this is vague but I'm not sure how to write all of this.

1972,"I did everything I was told to do. For years. It doesn't workAnyone who looks at my post history can probably tell this is a venting account, and as people can see,I have been like this for a very long time. Ever since I stopped being a Christian back in the mid 2010s

I have done everything. I have a 40 hour a week job. I exercise no less than 3 times a week. I had sex. I did meditation, even trying to join a new religion. I have gone to 3 different therapists. I have played tabletop games.

I've did everything people told me that I just needed to try out. Guess what: I still want to die. It has gotten worse. I can't stop thinking about dying. I constantly am daydreaming about people being beaten to death. There is no morality. I don't even know what's right or wrong anymore. Any moral system that I try gets ""UHM ACKTUALLY"" 'd by some psudo philosophical idiot nihilist redditor that rules the modern world now. Worst part is that I have no good argument against them. It really is meaningless.

I am just here for no reason and I hate it. It isn't fun. It's scary and I just want to stop getting out of bed anymore. I just get up because I don't know what else to do. I want to jump off a building already.

I don't have much more to say. I'm sorry. This is so dumb. Everyone says to find a purpose. But that doesn't matter when rape, viruses, and murder surround us. Everyone alive now is gonna die in 100 years anyways",suicide

2001,"my life has become a nightmareTnis will be a long read but I'm very grateful for those who will read it. I'm going to start this off by saying I've never been a happy person. I've always seeked solace in philosophy &amp; drugs. I've done numerous drugs to try and help me. LSD, shrooms, tons of benzos &amp; opiates, MDMA, but they always only help temporarily. I've been depressed. Always. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I can't remember the way I was before it ever came into my life. But life somehow started looking up for me, I had a well paying job, drugs, close friends, a girlfriend, a car, and just my freedom. I had everything I've ever wanted in life. I wasn't happy but I was content and had a hope for my future.

Until two weeks ago where I made the worst decison of my life ; that was driving when I was fucked up. I was coming home from a day filled with popping pills and smoking with friends, &amp; I made the most selfish, stupid decision of driving under various substances. I swerved and my wheel came off the road, lost traction and pummeled me into a pickup truck. I was on the highway going 60. My car got totalled. Ambulance had to bust the windows in the back because my car flipped to get me out.I was fine besides hurting my neck and some major bruises. But I admitted in the emergency room that I was messed up &amp; under various drugs. I got arrested and charged for wreckless driving, DUI, &amp; plenty of drug charges they found in my car after. I'm failing all my classes. I've always had a great GPA, a really good ACT score to get me into a decent college with a nice scholarship but ive ruined that future. Besides losing my future, friends, job, car, money, freedom, &amp; my reputation. I put two other people in the hospital. 

One of them is a father. Has kids. &amp; He's been in the hospital since. He has a broken neck &amp; in a lot of pain. I couldn't imagine what I would do to some fucker who almost killed my mom because of their dumbass decisions. Ive been living with the guilt since. That I almost killed another person, almost made some kids live without their father. I'm the lowest person and I honestly feel like I don't deserve to live. I wish I never wore my searbelt, that I was killed in the crash. I truly deserve it. Insurance isn't going to cover any medical bills. I put myself and my mom in thousands of dollars in debt. We cant afford that. She works as a single mother, supporting three kids as a fast food manager. Besides contemplating suicide daily because of living with this guilt amd regret that eats me up 24/7. Ive lost everything. I've become a disgrace to my family, to society. My brother tells me daily how I should've died &amp; how much of a piece of shit I am. My dad was a drug addict who left our family at the age of 6, and my mom &amp; brother tell me how I'm far worse than him. It hurts so fucking much. All of this does. I can't bear this emotional pain. I never meant to hurt anyone in my entire life. Ive always been so nice and caring to others because I know life is hard &amp; I only wish to bring good to others. But I've fucked my life up beyond repair.  

I don't see a way out of this. I don't want one. I just wish I had the fucking balls to end this guilt and misery I feel ALL the fucking time. I can't keep living. I don't deserve to. The only person who has a little faith in me is my girlfriend. I love this girl to death. She's the most amazing person I've ever met. Shes the only one who has faith in me &amp; support me. But I can't even see her with no car. I don't have a phone to talk to her. I'm probably going to lose her too. I hate that I'm making people suffer because of my decisons. These poor people I almost killed, my family, my girlfriend, my friends. I've truly lost everything. I hope so much that I just can end it all. To stop feeling this misery. To never have to see another day. Hopefully one day I will. Thank you for reading.",suicide

2006,"Thoughts about suicide became everyday routineThis is happening during last 3 years. It started pretty weak, I thought about suicide once in a month, but then it became worse and worse. I already had 4 real suicide attempts which ended up in reanimation. Actual planning of suicide and not such successful attempts were way more than 4. 

Today thoughts about suicide became my everyday routine before I go to sleep. Sometimes this is the only thing that can make me fall asleep - knowing that one day I will finally die and this all will end. It make me feel calm. I know this is sick. I never wanted my life to be this way. But this is how it is. 

One thing that I wish more than anything is that one lucky day I will have real opportunity to do it. When I'll be all alone and I'll be in right mood. I'll drink some alcohol and hang myself. 

P.S. Yes, I recovered by depression with meds and therapist. You can see that this didn't help. Mental health care is very poor in my country. So no one will help me. I don't even know why I write it here, just some kind of venting. ",suicide
2007,"I thought I was ready to kill myselfI had a hot bath, I cut my left wrist and was planning to just bleed out, i thought it was pretty aesthetic how the water started to look, and how the blood was flowing from my wrists. I started to feel scared, very scared. I'm an atheist, and I accept that there is nothing after we die, but coming so close to it made me scared. Or maybe I'm just a pussy, or going out hannah baker style isn't how I want to go.

I think i'll make a bucket list before I die. There's a few things I want to do before I die. I've never eaten a steak before, I think I'll try that. I did check off one thing from my bucket list today now that I think about it. I think I'll revisit some old memories from when I was a kid, the area isn't far from me. 

I'm good looking, funny, confident, great hair, great voice, i have women, i have money, but I'm not happy. My entire personality feels empty, I just emulate whatever character I've seen before, for whatever suits the situation. I don't really feel like a person. When i'm not trying to emulate anyone, all I really am is just angry, edgy, unfunny, blunt, and above all just stubborn. My refusal to change as I grew up is ultimately why I am suffering, my suffering has always been my own fault.

I realised that my attitudes towards women and my outlook on life stems from my deep hatred of my mother, growing up and even now I wanted nothing more for her to die and suffer. I wish I had talked about this to someone earlier. Maybe I would have been able to become someone more functional. I suppose the feeling of betrayal from the person I loved most will never leave me, it will always hurt, and I just can't seem to forget. 

My wrists really hurt, i'm in no danger of dying anymore, I'm just dizzy and want water. Maybe I don't even want to die, if i truly dead I wouldn't be alive right now. Or perhaps its the natural instinct to survive that's restricting me?",suicide

I need to be loved and wanted or there is no point being alive. I feel like a massive burden to my wife and family. Im deeply ashamed that i havent succeded in life like my brother and sister.

I just want to die a really painfull harsh death so that i can be punished for the disharmony i have created on this earth.

I only seem to be able to remember the negitive things that happen to me. People always seem to use then discard me. My mother died when i was 17 and i never remotely got over it. Its still as raw as when it happened. All i can do is try not to think about her.

2039,"I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff, have been unemployed for 1.5 years so I will be choosing between suicide and ??? very soon. Open to unusual suggestions.**Just read the bold text as a TL/DR if you want.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree - German - that I deeply regret in December 2014. The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues. I have a little OCD, some Borderline Personality Disorder traits, and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II. I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either. I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis. **I have spent 3 out of the 4 years since I graduated unemployed.** It took me a year to find a job. I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly. That happened just eight months after I had left my parents' house. I didn't even make it a year on my own. That was a year and a half ago. I cannot find a fucking job. I have tried everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree. Over the past month, for example, I have applied to 185 jobs and only made it to a 2nd round in-person interview 4 times. So here we are...* 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm ready to die. I have a note and a plan.** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from. On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes, he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met. My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them. We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past. **There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the 4 people who are part of my life behind.** I have read enough of r/SuicideBereavement to know what it'd do to them and I don't care most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **My suicide method of choice is irreversible. Guaranteed to kill me.** This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn't take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn't high enough. I will be gone. Thus, I must be very certain about having no other options left. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you'll say ""why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents?"" *That is not something I can accept*. I didn't push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this.** This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now, there is no way I could work at Macy's or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself**. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either.** I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed. I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds. Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems. I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**At this point, I don't know what the fuck I can do. Here are the things that occur to me at this point, in order from most reasonable to least:** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a ""temp to permanent"" role that actually pans out. The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house, even if it is full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful. That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living. It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway. I have a car that is worth around $10,000 that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept my suicide as inevitable - living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible - and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else. $10k gets you a long way in a third world country. You may laugh at this but I'm actually kind serious about this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kill myself. Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it. That's it. This miserable existence I never asked for would be over. I have had sex, fallen in love, been to Europe, enjoyed meaningful friendships, done psychedelics. Its been nice. But I can't take this shit anymore at the same time. Every day is the same. Sitting at this fucking desk. Miserable. Insane. Lonely. Hopeless. I think about suicide constantly.

2050,"Never thought I'd be having suicidal thoughts.I don't really care that this is my main account.

I'm currently camping with my four best friends in the world. We planned this trip for ages and now it's actually happening, but once again my mental illness ruins things for everyone. Last night I freaked out because they wanted to go for a walk in the woods at midnight without phone signal and I was terrified they might die. One of my friends gave me a much deserved talking to and said that the world shouldn't revolve around me, which is of course right. I shouldn't be controlling them, it's just the anxiety talking.

I stayed up with my absolute best friend and another friend until three, when we decided to go to bed. However, despite knowing I was in a fragile mental state my best friend decides to go off and leave me upset. I messaged them asking just to chat because I was lonely, to be told that I was making a big deal out of nothing and I should forget about it. You can't just forget anxiety issues, they're always there.

I cried myself to sleep, then woke early this morning shaking. Some mean part of me wanted to make them worry about me as much as I worry about them, so I took my blanket and went for a long walk in the woods to see if I could spot some wild boar. I got back after about an hour but noone had contacted me asking where I was even though I knew they were awake, so I went and sat by the cafe and browsed reddit until one friend found me. She said she'd been looking everywhere for me and that my best friend was worried sick. I was finally happy - he actually cared.

When we got back to the tent, he was asleep. I don't know about you but when I'm worried sick about someone I don't fall asleep until they're found. I left again. I'm now sat by the cafe again crying my eyes out. I'm always there for them, but I never feel like they care for me at all. I'm entertaining suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life - maybe if I killed or seriously injured myself they'd finally care about me?

Of course people who love you would miss you. I would miss you. It would be devastating!""   That seems little short of guilt tripping.  I won't say it's totally ineffective, but I kind of expected more from a DBT intensive therapist.  Or does DBT assume that the greatest motivation is positive attention? Because it totally leverages the therapuetic relationship like it means more to me than anything else in the world.  Like, Sorry, you're ok and all, but you're just my therapist. I don't even know you.  Self harm has been officially unamed ""unacceptable,"" and is punnishable by 24 hours of no contact/no phone coaching.  Phone coaching, the thing they're supposed to try to get you to use instead of trying (again) to kill yourself... If somebody's so desperate they're self-harming, possibly with intent to kill.  You can totally fix it by leveraging the need for continued attention against the need to feel better at any cost.  For the love of god, why is there the assumption someone really just wants attention more than anything, and if they get it for being ""good"" (presenting as asymptomatic) and not for being ""bad"" (symptomatic), they'll stop self harming or attempting suicide (being symptomatic)?   You cannot just *manipulate* me out of being suicidal.  That's not how this works.  I came to DBT for a robust empirically proven form of therapy that is supposedly... heavy-duty, or industrial strength or whatever.  Supposedly perfect for severely depressed chronically suicidal people.  That's what I came for, but I'm not sure what it is that I'm getting.  It assumes people are illogical attention-motivated children above all else.   While I'm not some mastermind genius, I find that pretty insulting.  What, do I get a gold star for each day without self-harm, too?  I know! Let's go full out in behaviorism and do a token economy.  /s  I'm studying psychology and neuroscience, and this shit does not jive with what I've been taught to expect of DBT.  I'm disappointed, really.  Flat out salty.  That and it's full of jargon that I can hardly begin to parse out.  My therapist says I need to work on my Committment to Living like it's a proper noun or something. Oh and Mindfulness as a cure to everything including all misery of existence.  I don't like mindfulness, I actually kind of hate it, and the deep breathing bullshit too.  It doesn't work.

Your actions do it. Nature doesn't kill you, you don't die just randomly, no you fucking do it. Isn't that awesome? I think it is...because death is fucking great, and your own actions cause it. I love death. And today death is going to become reality for me. I'm really depressed and i have anxiety, but i haven't told anyone. Because i just don't see the point in it really. What good would that do me? I get help...and i kill myself some other time. Because that's just the way my brain is. So fuck it Reddit. Let's go out with a bang shall we.

2064,"I want to die honorableI don't know if this is suicidal but I want to die in a way that I myself find glorious. While I know I would never harm myself willingly, I yet desire to cease existing.   
But as the good nature in me calls for doing something good and helping others I want to die in a battle. I would like to join some militia or organization that fights terror groups or generally saves other people so I could at least do something good for other people one last time before I leave.  
And in case I don't die from that then great. But I doubt it because I am not good. I have never been to the military because my health problems are too much of a burden. And where I live almost every male goes to the military at adult age. So I also feel like I am missing out on something important even though I don't regret having to go there. But yet perhaps that would make it up for this. I mean someone without experience like me will die fast anyway, right? So doing something good and something I feel proud of while leaving with honorable actions is just the perfect setup.   
Because else I am just a burden and non-loved by anyone. I cannot love myself because I can only do that if others love me as well. I am the kind of person that depends on others. I have to push myself and if I can't go on I just feel horrible.  
For years I have tried following my dreams, actually doing my best to achieve things in life but all failed. Sure I tried and did my best, there is nothing more I can do. But this is exactly what bothers me. If my best isn't enough to continue, what else can I do? You don't wanna see me try my worst if my best is already that horrible...  
And I had enough always having to fight for things I never get in the end while others get it laid out on their hands. Be it job and career or love life.   
Sure I have friends and family, I have a roof over my head and food on the plate.   
But life is more than just surviving, especially in these times where society expects much more of someone.  
I often say I just wanna die but when I say I wanna die I really just mean I wanna finally start living and not just surviving like right now. But the more days pass, the more I think perhaps it actually is for the better if I do die.  
Today it pushed me on the edge, I had to hold a blade to my throat and chest for the first time in many many years. To think I really be pushed that hard...  
But I don't know why for some reason I still do have hope. I kinda always have hope for something. I cannot explain this phenomenon. Even if I think I plan to die in battle, I yet have hope to leave it alive and gaining new experience and mindset that could change me positively. Even in such negativity, I find positivity. But this all is a double-edged sword. the one side that has hope that something good could happen but the other side that is right now a bit sharper than the other, the side that just wants me to die.

Gas is something you have to pay for there, which they voted on (red state). republicans dont think gas should be provided by the government and because they voted against it, it isn't. It was a really bad snowstorm as a result of climate change (one of the worst in texas history, and they don't get much snow there).

So, some people can't afford the gas and the concern is they'll freeze to death in their own homes because they don't have gas. Gas isn't just heat either, their water isn't being treated by the state right now and stoves aren't working to cook. 

At least 25 people have died as of 24 hours ago. To give you an idea of it 3 kids died when they accidentally lit their house on fire trying to stay warm and a man was found frozen to death in his recliner.

2113,"I feel ugly, and it makes me feel like I have less value as a person.I deal with body dysmorphia. Not that the things I see don't exist, but I realize that I obsess over my appearance more than most people do.

I find myself hideous. My face slants. It's fucked up that I couldn't just have a normal face. Doesn't have to be gorgeous. But I mean, my whole fucking face slants to the side. Logically, I know that people probably don't care. But I constantly think about when I am talking to people. I see it. I obsess over plastic surgery. I obsess over ways to make it less noticeable. It's going to cost around $20-30,000 if I want to fix it. Part of the problem is I have a cross under bite. So it makes my jaw slant to the left. But then I have a droopy eye. Which looks more apparent because of the slanted jaw. If I want to get the eye fixed that's around $3-5000. Even my fucking ears are slanted. My face looks like I had bell's palsy, but without the complete loss of muscle movement in the side of my face. 

These things aren't in my head. I wish I had full on body dysmorphia where I just see things that aren't real. I've posted on /r/rateme and people have pointed out exactly the things I see. When I was a kid and got my ears pierced at the mall, they said they normally would pierce one ear a little higher and the other a little lower to make them look symmetrical. However, my ears are so crooked that they couldn't even do that. You can't even surgically fix crooked ears.  Today I went and got botox, and the lady recommended that I get microblading for my eyebrows because it would make my eye look less droopy. Which of course I'm going to do (but not with her), because if I can make myself look less crooked for a couple hundred bucks then yes I'm going to do it. Beats the several thousand. 


My family thinks I'm vain. Which I guess I am. But you know, that's pretty freaking easy for them to say. Somehow I was the only one born with a half smashed face. I'm the ugly duckling. But I'm superficial because I want to get work done to make myself look normal. 

I understand that I'm being shallow. Of course people still will talk to me even if I'm ugly. I'm great at making friends. But you know what I'm not good at? Getting guys I love to stay. They move on to much prettier girls. I'm the girl they date while they have low self-esteem. I have a nice body. I'm the girl they want to hit and quit. You bang the body, but you marry for the face. 

I just don't think I'll be at peace in my head until I get the surgeries done. But I can't afford them. Sure, you'll probably tell me that it won't make me happy. I call bull shit. When I was younger, I had an eating disorder. I hated my body. I hated my thighs and wanted that coveted thigh gap. Now, years later, I work out, and like I said, I have a good body with curves. But I also now have that coveted thigh gap. And you know what? I fucking love it. It makes me feel good that I can stand with my feet together and my thighs don't touch. Dumb that I put so much value on it? Yeah, probably. But it rings true that if I fixed my other physical flaws that it would make me feel better too.",suicide

I‚Äôve been going through a prolonged period of being suicidal (I‚Äôm talking fucking years dude) and I‚Äôm experiencing a serious spike right now. Everything is something I could kill myself with.

2135,"It came back.I am a M(12). I live in a very christian neighborhood.I have attempted suicide in 2017, but have obviously failed. After that I started seeking out help keeping it a secret from everyone including my parents. I recovered by the mid-end of spring 2018, and have accidentally told some people that I have attempted suicide, but luckily they think it was a joke.

The reason for the depression (I have never actually been diagnosed but had all of the symptoms) is abuse I have been yelled at and beaten since kindergarten (about 5 years old) and have been humiliated and bullied for my looks (overweight) since the start of primary school. And increasing pressure to fulfill my high expectations (straight As). And during all of this being told that the abuse was ""normal"".

Ever since my recovery I have been making efforts to get slimmer which were mostly stopped by my parents saying that I cant go on a diet because I was so young (instead of a diet I just started eating healthier), my dad stopped beating me because he knew I was getting stronger (working out) and would fight back. But the emotional manipulation and verbal abuse did not stop. 

On the start of august I was staying at my Aunts and Uncles house for a week. And that week was great, because I had no expectations, I kept working out, I kept a stable weight, I had a cat who made it way less lonely being inside most of the time. But then I came back home. And on the SECOND DAY of me being back my dad just came out of nowhere and tried to kiss me, but my arm got in the way. Immediately he started yelling at me saying that I have no respect for him, that I do not know what love, and that I do not love him, and how ungrateful I am for all he has done for me. He also yelled that    he will take away all my rights including free speech. And whenever I tried to say anything he would cut me off and yell ""DO NOT ANSWER ME!"". He said that he hated how I was relaxed when he started yelling at me.

This is after another similar case that happened a few weeks ago when we went on a walk and he started yelling at me because food is not all I want from him. As I said this is similar to the case described above. Except that in this one I had a mental breakdown, he punched me, and gave me a promise that we will never get angry at each other ever again (I knew this was bullshit) except if I ""screw up"".

And the day after he yelled at me, made me cry enough to fill 100 of those ""male tears"" mugs, and broke a promise. The next day he acted as if nothing happened. One thing he got right that night is that I do not love him, I realized I do not love him 2 years ago. If it was not for the laws of this country I would have murdered him, but I could not even defend myself because of how emotionally overwhelmed I was, I could not say anything I just imagined killing him.

And ever since that day the suicidal thoughts came back, slowly but they did. And now I do not have emotional support I don't know who to tell this, except you.",suicide

2142,"It's been One YearI kind of have a weird tradition I've been technically doing for nearly a decade now, though it's also sort of off and on. See, every year after my most recent suicide attempt, I celebrate it's anniversary. Whether it's a treat to myself or, as was with this past Wednesday, spending the day with myself, I look back on the day I last attempted. I refect on the year and whether or not I think it's been worth surviving.

However, this past ""anniversary"" was the first one I could actually celebrate in about four years. Since my first one, I've attempted seven times, and four of those have been stopping said celebration for just under half a decade. You'd think I'd have gotten better since it's finally been a year, right?

There's not that urge to go and jump off something or to slice myself open, but rather a void that's growing inside. Not necessarily something that is sucking me dry, but rather attempting to fill me up with the emptiness. I'm constantly trying to fight this, but I'm thrown a curve ball each time.

There's nothing I can do, is there? There's no point in celebrating if I keep losing. I'm just hurting so much, and I know I'm too broken to be fixed. If I can't even appreciate the year since my last attempt, what's the point?",suicide

2161,"Please helpI'm 19, I'm in college, my parents are still together. I have a roof over my head, food on the table and a boyfriend that cares greatly for me. So what could possibly be wrong with me? Why do I hate everything so much? 

I'm so afraid that I'm not good enough for my boyfriend. I'm not good enough for my parents or my family. I have virtually no friends. Nobody cares about me except for my boyfriend but I know I'm wearing him down.

I was raped when I was 16 by a random man. He pushed me against the wall and pinned me by wrapping his hands around my neck. He pulled off my pants and began to feel around before he pulled down his own pants and raping me. I've never told anyone this until now, but his memory haunts me every night.

When I was younger my father used to grope me and when I reached puberty he began to touch me even more inappropriately. To this day, I can't look at my father the same way.

My boyfriend and I just recently started having sex. He's my first, besides that man. He doesn't know about this, but sometimes when we're intimate...I just get flash backs of that night when I was raped, and sometimes of my father.

I live every day scared, scared of running into that man once more. Scared of losing the only person that cares about me. Scared of my father touching me. 

My parents abuse me. They choke me until I pass out, and throw things at me. Things that would break bones or skin if I didn't dodge out of the way. They hit me almost every day just because they can.

I don't have the social skills or life skills to make my life any better because I am a terrific failure. I've learned to surround myself with people who wouldn't judge or criticize me even for my own good. I stopped talking to a lot of my family but they didn't want anything to do with myself or my dad and siblings anyway. I've wanted to die for more than 13 years. I'm really really tired. The only thing that would drive me when I was younger was thinking eventually I could support myself making artwork and music or just creating. As much as it's the only emotional outlet I have left I realize how pointless it is without already being wealthy. I work retail. I will never afford an education. Taking loans is suicide anyway.  I hate myself and I'm fully aware of the deep resentment most people feel for the fact that myself and people like me exist. I am going to kill myself eventually because I can't possibly live in the us being who I am. Escapism was really the last thing I had left.

2172,"I was told to post hereHello,

So I made [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/jwwh9/dae_have_suicidal_thoughts_on_a_daily_basis/) last night somebody told me to make a post here. 

So basically I've been having suicidal thoughts for a few years now - thoughts like how I'd kill myself, who would be effected, what if anything would happen to me afterwards. Never really crossed into serious planning, but at one point I put aside a bottle of Oxycotin and Vodka and hid it in my bookcase. It's made me feel really good to just have it sit there, but I have no plans to use it.

I don't think I'm depressed - I'll have my waves of bad thoughts but I'd say a good 80% of my day is me having genuine fun and being happy. 

I just don't really know where to go from here. I thought the suicidal thoughts I was having were as normal as people's murder/rape thoughts. Happens a few times a day but never anything serious, so no harm no foul, right? But reading some comments last night and this morning have led me to believe that suicidal thoughts are not normal, but I'm pretty confident mine are just thoughts and will never lead to actions.

Should I just go on with my life like normal?",suicide

2192,"Extreme anxiety over potential crime, advice neededI (19M) have been struggling tremendously with OCD, especially recently, and my recent intrusive thoughts are causing me tremendous anxiety and rumination.

Relatively recently (think a few weeks/months ago), I messaged multiple girls from nsfw subreddits such as gonewild.  Nearly every single time, there was no reply.  However, my mind just thought of something which is giving me tremendous anxiety.  What if the people I messaged were underaged, even though I didn‚Äôt know about it?  I always subconsciously assumed, due to those subreddits having an 18+ limit, that I would only be messaging adults, however my mind is going insane thinking that they may have been underaged.  I never thought that I was messaging anybody underaged, and if I ever had reasonable suspicion that a person was, I would never have even thought about messaging them.

I don‚Äôt know how valid it is, but I‚Äôm just thinking that what I did is a horrible crime and that I‚Äôm going to get sentenced to prison for multiple years for what I did.  I‚Äôm incredibly anxious that I‚Äôm in some kind of legal trouble due to what I did.  This is my sole cause of the anxiety.  If there is any lawyer or person with extensive legal knowledge, could they please comment and let me know if I am going to go to prison for this.

I swear, I never knowingly messaged an underaged person.  To this day, every person I have messaged, I do not have a single reason to believe was underaged.

I feel bad for these people who aren‚Äôt getting this necessary attention from a group of people they are trying to share their hardest  struggles with, but then it also makes me feel weirdly good I‚Äôm not the only one who is neglected by the open public. I see one post with hundreds of upvotes, but the next with ten. The thing that saddens me is that there is no way to fix that. Just like the real world, we can‚Äôt fix and help everybody, and our standpoint is to always help ourselves first. This is really random but whatever.",suicide

Even though I had no real intention of killing myself, I did put my head in and let it choke me a bit and possibly hoped I‚Äôd slip and accidentally end up hanging myself.

I feel like I‚Äôm too sensitive for this world. And that sensitivity is seen as a negativity by most, I care about people too much, I get attached and when I‚Äôm scared to lose them I end up pushing them away because I‚Äôm too intense in wanting to let them know how valued they are to me. Most recently a friend from work, who i admitted having feelings for when drunk on a night out, who was a good friend. A month ago she was telling me how thoughtful I was due to the gifts I‚Äôd got her. Now, she wants nothing to do with me and I know it‚Äôs basically because I sent a way too intense text about still wanting to retain the friendship.

This has been a pattern for me - I develop these great friendships and then get close and ruin it - with my best friend after we had kissed and now with this colleague. I try and rein it in but I just can‚Äôt help it. With this lady, I genuinely felt we flirted and feel stupid for misreading the signs, she had been getting touchy feely a bit towards the end, patting my butt and joking I was her work-husband (she is single).

When this happens I feel it erases all the positive things they thought about me, because one mistake and I end up losing all that, so it doesn‚Äôt matter how funny they found me, how thoughtful she thought I was, in the end I just ruin it.

I don‚Äôt feel I have anything to offer because the positive traits weren‚Äôt enough and I feel like I‚Äôm just not good enough and there must be something fundamentally wrong with me. My ex told me she loved me, spent one week on holiday with me after she cried 2 hours after getting there due to homesickness, and after 2 weeks of looking after her dumped me when we got back. From ‚Äòsoulmate‚Äô to dumping me after 10 days together where I pretty much just looked after her and cancelled my trip early to get her back home (I had planned it for a year and spent a lot of money).

I feel like I‚Äôm too sensitive for a man, and that I‚Äôm not attractive due to it and have nothing to offer and could never be in a long relationship or close friendship due to how sensitive I am. And that I just at care too much about people and get hurt when they leave.

And I really am just tired of it now. I‚Äôm 31 but I feel like I‚Äôve been struggling for so long.",suicide

2236,At what point is suicide acceptable? How many more days/months/years do I have to wait?28 year old female over here woo fucking hoo. Been depressed suicidal on and off since I can remember. Couple of failed attempts in my teens. It's been 8 months since my depression hit hard again. I keep setting a date then moving it. At this point if I try I'm not going to fail. Gotta buy a gun still. Been doing my research on how best to succeed. Just trying to plot the end. At what age is it finally going to be reasonable to throw in the towel? Do I really need to wait it out for years until it becomes so blaringly obvious that this life isn't worth the trouble. Seems like I've already figured that out but I keep holding on just in case. Not many more years left before spinsterdom sets in. Maybe 30? If I can make it that long. I don't know something's gotta give. I'm no spring chicken. I don't want to grow old and alone. At a certain point my life goals will be out of reach and I'll be left with nothing. At that time suicide is fair. It's just. It's reasonable. At this time I'm just waiting for my father to die so I don't have anyone to hurt. Maybe I answered my own question when he goes I will too. I just feel like if I set a reasonable date and stick to it all this pressure will be lifted. I'll have a goal. Just make it through until that date. I can do that. it's the unending road thats daunting. If there's a date I can compartmentalize. I can rest easy knowing the end is in sight. But when???,suicide
2237,"I see it quite clearly now. Suicide IS the best option for me.I've been meditating a lot recently and I've come to the conclusion that there simply is no reason for me to be here. I don't like or care for anything in the world. I don't understand why someone with a mental illness would want to get better. There is nothing on the other end. I guess there is for some people, but not for me. Not because no one cares for me, some do, but because I don't care for anyone or anything. I don't care that my family will miss me and wonder what they did wrong. They did nothing wrong except for creating me. None of this would've happened had I not existed, and that's their burden to bear. I have hobbies to pass the time. When I don't think much about it I like them. When I actually think deeply about it I realise how pointless they are.

I guess I would like to be convinced otherwise, but none of your false optimism is going to sway me. Things could get better, sure, but if I was dead I would never know, so what's the point in risking even more suffering for myself? As I said, the suffering of others is of no concern to me.

I'm here to talk to whoever would love to talk to someone.  
I'm a 22 year old female who has been blessed with good opportunities in life. I had a terrible bout in high school where I felt I went insane. I felt I had no control over my emotions, thoughts, and at times my own actions. I was put on medication and was almost sure I self-diagnosed myself with BPD. Fast forward a few years and I quit the meds and am mentally stable, even truly happy. 

But the last month or two things have been dwindling it feels. I have always been a daily bud smoker, but my alcohol consumption upped and I'm feeling best when asleep. This morning I woke up feeling empty, nothing. I couldn't get myself out of bed and had to call into work. I spent all day sleeping because being asleep is almost like not being alive... a small coma. I wouldn't consider suicide these days, but also some days I really wouldn't mind not being alive.

My psychiatrist believes that depression is a teenage fad. I haven't made any friends since I was 12, and it was the only close friend I've ever had. We're parted now. I am truly alone. Entrusive thoughts about self-harm and suicide make cold run down my limbs.

2262,"Im trying, but things keep getting worseI got into a Masters course last year and have done quite well so far, only to realize that my college's professors simply do not know enough about the subject and are continuously placing obstacles in our path. My dissertation is also getting ruined by the tardiness of labs and my team member, who is too busy with her own research to care for mine. Yes, the most appealing solution would be to shift labs, but it is going to take me eons to do that, and my samples(which are biological) will get destroyed all the same. So even though i have put in more effort than most of my classmates, i am staring on the brink of failure and i badly want to give up.   
I don't have anything to live for except the fact that it will make my family unhappy. I have a few online friends i care for, but beyond that, i have no social life worth talking about. I decided to avoid relationships after my gf's death from cancer last year, which is again a source of continuous mental turmoil. And the therapists in my country are assholes, besides, i simply cannot spare any time for therapy.   
Why should i not die? Is there any point in continuing to embarrass myself further? People keep telling me about how these failures are making me stronger, but they're not. Im 26 and i should've completed my education long ago. This isn't a fantasy world where a person has unlimited resources and time. I have never come across a worse phrase than ""failures are the stepping stones of success"". Perhaps its applicable for people who don't have much to lose.

She sauntered into the room, her enormous breasts swaying from side-to-side like a great grandfather clock, glistening enticingly, her massive nipples clinging to the underside of the latex bra she just happened to be wearing at 2 PM on a Monday evening.

The throbbing mounds that adorned her colossal melons seemed as if to emit a high-pitched grown. A dog whistle of sorts. A siren call that made my 18-inch penis immediately stand at attention like a marine in the dog house.

I stumbled over to her, my massive shaft swaying from side-to-side, rocking the whole house with it. Upon closer inspection, her giant conkers were even more impressive that I'd first thought. Sprinkled lightly with freckles, like a perfectly peppered biscuit, she had the most beautiful bongos I'd ever gazed upon.

I let out a primal yell and immediately entered her, causing her to spout cum violently before completing the first thrust. We were still clothed. Such was the power of my immense man meat that I penetrated her clothing and simultaneously found entrance to her clitoris. Like climbing some massive mossy meat mountain, I erected my shaft at the top and declared victory. This wasn't my first sexual encounter. I've had sex with at least 9 other women. Still, something about this one was special.

Still inside her, I could feel her ovaries trembling. My gigantic cock had curled inside her like fruit by the foot, now spurting from her mouth as if a great cum-fountain.

My dad was violent and alcoholic in my youth. Me and my siblings got used to live in fear. My mother ditched him when I was seven, only 'cause my little brother got cancer (if he would've gotten abused while being sick, he could've died). He survived, but I was always put aside (naturally, 'cause he was sick and I was healthy). I was good at school, I've always liked it. Fast forward to age 15. I was raped. It ruined me. I started to drink (a lot), and to hang with older guys. I started to date one. I moved in with him when in high school. Drinking was our favorite hobby. He also introduced me to some drugs (cannabis, LSD, MDMA etc.) Then... I tried to kill myself. I nearly succeeded (death was few minutes away). I went to hospital for a while and when I got back to home, I continued all my bad habits.

Now I'm in university, but I just can't do THIS anymore. I should've graduated half an year ago, but I'm lazy and stupid. Also my fiancee (formerly mentioned as the old guy) hates me nowadays. I'm disgusting, stupid water buffalo in his opinion (yeah, I've gained weight and I don't look like a 16 years old anymore). It's sad 'cause I know it's true.

2332,"It's my 22nd birthday and that's 22 too much for me**+++ For the record, I'm not following any of the shit ideas my head has. At least don't intend to. +++**

All my life I've been abandoned, neglected and traumatized, got around 50 traumata. I am alone, I have no family as they are totally shitty. My ""friends"" also abandoned me, I'm just not good enough or too annoying.

One of the first things I did around midnight (almost 1am now) is posting a depressing meme to reddit which I prepared an hour before. Whilst crying. I am sitting alone in my room and nobody is here. I feel dead inside and at the same time like I'm about to explode.

My head is constantly having thoughts like ""What could we do today? What about overdosing on painkillers or so?"" or before when I was in a subway thinking that I should better be below it and that's really annoying. Also I know that it's not the best way anyway and I wouldn't want to involve others in such a thing. That'd be awful. It is my 22nd birthday and I feel like I should ask for an apology that I wasn't aborted. Everyone resents me in the end and there's nothing I can do about it.

My whole family is hateful and especially towards me, my mother which whom I also cut contact by now confirmed that my father would likely be glad if I committed suicide. I just wanna vanish. I can't because I lost someone to suicide and this feeling - I just can't make the ones I love feel like that. As much as I want to cease to exist.

I. Hate. Everything.

I don't know what to do and I don't know why I am even writing this when I don't actually intend to do anything? Whatever. In a month I am 2 years selfharm-free (used to cut myself heavily) and even that doesn't cause any emotions but missing having a way to cope. Eating disorder flaring up so I get at least a fake sense of control. Maybe I die from this, then nobody loses me to suicide, chance is 15%. But maybe another of my diseases gets me first.

I had so many fights, but yet I can't revolt against them more than I already did cause I need this damn job.

So I'm super stressed at work but when I go back home there's my damn family situation, my mom says in 5 days the judge is coming to our home to see what can be taken away and sold so the state can get his tax money back, the ones my dad wasn't able to pay. ""Fortunately"" (I don't really care) they said if we give them 4000 euro right now they'll make us a payment plan for the restant 40000 euros... So I'll have to ""lend"" my money to my dad again (I know I'll never see them back) this month and the same story comes along every damn month.
My dad has debts everywhere, I don't even know how much, and my mom says I'll have to hold on for other like 3-4 years in this cursed situation. 
But this is just an random estimate. I'm forced in this situation, I'm 23 years old and don't know when I'll be free, maybe when I'll be 30?
Our home is under risk every month.

Then, even worst, my mom is sick, she can't work, my dad left and betrayed her, I DON'T love her but I feel forced to take care of here until she dies or takes away her own life.
I don't have any mental illness, I'd like to become a music producer, to make money, I think love is so stupid and I don't care for anyone other than my self, and I believe everyone is egoistic too in the deep inside, but yet I'm scared of death, feel so coward.

I can't seem to be able to draw anything that isn't edgy.

I hate this word. Edgy. No wonder I can't look at my own art without feeling gross. 

I just read through other people's abuse histories and life struggles. And here I am, pondering what shade of ugu sobstory I wanna paint with, to represent my inner struggle of lying in a smelly bad and feeling sorry for myself.

If I am edgy, I want to die. I already am so many things. A dropout, dramatic, a loser, ugly, dirty,  probably very selfish and potentially abusive. A liar, vain. If the one hobby that brings me joy turns out to have been tainted, and wasted by my own trashy emo existence, I will kill myself. The last thing that I want to be is an edgy joke.",suicide

I have a job that earns me a lot of money, I study mechanical engineering and I'm living together with a very loving and caring girlfriend. It wasn't easy to achieve all of this but I thought if I force myself to put in some energy to make it better I'd actually feel better. But I don't.  I even feel worse.

 I got in my car and drove home with very loud music, like a maniac. Way too fast, ignoring every rule you could possibly think of hoping to crash and die eventually.  I even almost drove off a bridge once and into a wall thrice but changed my mind seconds before the impact every time.

Anyways, I don't know why. It's something I've tried to be vocal about but I find that in modern days those who ""want to help"" are far more fucking annoying than those who will just have a logical conversation with ideas, opinions, facts, thoughts to be shared. 

I'm not going to kill myself this second, nor do I plan on it. But I do often day dream of killing myself, how it'd affect others. And more recently, the past year or so after experimentation with pot, women, and living I really got a new perspective. I was no longer that basement dwelling kid who played video games all day, but instead I'd smoke, bang hot chicks, and have friends. 

Well that's how everyone wants me to live my life, but I don't, and I can't be happy doing what I used to do. I find that more often than not, as of recent, I've wanted to kill myself not for the harm and sadness it'd cause others, but more because I can no longer take others...

I don't know, my point is, I know I don't love the first girl, my friend so I instead went and hugged my mother and told her I loved her, and she gave me a groan and a pissy face unlike normal (normal meaning, the other ~4 times I've gone up to my mom in that manner, hugged her, and told her I loved her in the past year). I know its' just because of her current situation, having to go down to my sisters' house to wash clothes, and my brother getting on her nerves... ugh, I used to love the kid, seriously.

Since my mom died, I've been ready to follow her into the grave. But one morning I realized that my death would leave my sister in a worse position. I've spent months feeling like I'm having a heart attack, blood clot, or any number of deadly conditions. 

None of this matters. Everyone is going to leave. Family is supposed to be there for you forever but they won't be. They'll move on be it through death or any number of instances.

I wish I were never born. I wish I could have chosen if I wanted to exist. It seems pretty fucked up that we don't get a choice. It's a pretty big decision. I wish I had died as a child. I wish I had never seen the things I have.

Everything is boring or stupid. I can't fucking stand people anymore. Their little stupid quips here and there. They all think they're fucking special but they're not. No one is. This planet would be better off is half of us died anyway.

I can't get out of bed before noon, and I can't resist the urge to nap or else lay in bed staring at the walls for hours a day.

We all like to pretend that everything is a-okay. We like to think that ""we're strong as long as we're in this together"" or some bullshit. But you know what? Not a single one of us has some mystical power that makes things okay again. We're all fucking helpless.

I pushed it all down for years. I hid from the emotion and refused to acknowledge the issues. I was nicknamed ""Hitler"" in highschool because shit just rolled off my back. But everything has rolled into the station - full fucking steam ahead.

What am I supposed to do? Just be okay? Pretend that nothing happened? That shit doesn't just go away. There's no fucking magical potion that takes all the memories away - aside from bleach I guess - but memories make the person.

I heard some girls driving along in their fancy car with their family/friends. They had the windows down and were laughing loudly in traffic. I should be happy that someone else can find happiness, but I fucking hate them. I hate that little ignorant bitches can be happy like that. Their stupid high pitched squeals. They think they're so fucking special. But one day, three of the four people in that car will be dead, and one girl will remain. I wonder if things will be better for her. Who knows, they might be worse.

But when they're around, I can't connect at all. I find myself staring at them, nodding but not really hearing whatever it is they're talking about. I just stare.

I find myself staring at people in public too, sometimes hating them and other times not thinking at all.

Why does it matter if someone died today or years from now? It's just speeding the inevitable. Life is agony. I live for the next moment I can finally fall asleep again.

I have never been tested for it because I really don‚Äôt want the fuss and besides the medication doesn‚Äôt work, my mum was on fluoxetine which is an anti depressant and on the 18 th of february she slit her wrists knowing I was in the house but I have wrote about that before and I do not think I removed it so feel free to read it. I moved from my old school in nottingham to fucking cumbria (and no I am not that prick who is running for the youth council he is just some other guy from nottingham). cumbria is a shithole county full of shitty people who lead shitty lives and have shitty kids to contribute shit all to the shitty society but to be honest I don‚Äôt care about that, I just miss having friends irl. I made friends with a really nice girl from florida and we talk almost every day but due to the fact that it‚Äôs like 5 hours behind when I want to talk she is usually asleep or at school. I had 4 really good friends on csgo and we often played all through the day and night when I lived in nottingham but now I can‚Äôt even talk to them cause I have shit internet which has a data limit cause bt are cunts and don‚Äôt have a 6 month contract which we could have taken up for this house (a rental cause our house isn‚Äôt even fucking done yet).

I went to my councillor at school once after what happened but that was bullshit and she didn‚Äôt help. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing information about what I felt in case I was seen as a risk to myself and got sent to a mad house. I don‚Äôt want to go to a mad house cause I am not mad, i fact I believe myself to be the sanest person I know most of the time.

over the past month it seems like my life has been flipped upside down which has made all the shit that wasn‚Äôt boxed away in some distant part of my head spill everywhere. This couldn‚Äôt have came at a worse time this academic year as I am taking my mock exams for next years GCSE‚Äôs and when I am sat in the silent room I can‚Äôt stop thinking about what happened, replaying it over and over in my head. I usually do well in exams getting 9‚Äôs in science, 8‚Äôs in maths and computer science and 7‚Äôs in the rest (apart from french because french is the root of pure evil) but in these exams I don‚Äôt think I did well. I revised really hard for my maths exam but I don‚Äôt think I did well, I am close to being moved down to second set and if I do then I will be average at everything. I am gifted with chemistry and physics, well I assume so due to me getting better then the old A*‚Äôs a year early, but I am in a shit set and no teacher will move me. I feel afraid that if I fail these exams I will end up doing something stupid, I was gunna OD on my mums pills but I found out that they don‚Äôt work very well so that‚Äôs out the window. I just don‚Äôt know what to do, I just want everything to be over, I am nice to people and mind my own business and don‚Äôt try to be funny and just try to seem like a nice enough person to be friends with but it seems like it doesn‚Äôt work but I don‚Äôt want to change because then I would become that which I hate, people who try to be funny and seem funny but end up acting like cunts.

I've thought about killing myself a lot of times lately, I know that life is pointless, every human being is just dictated by its conservation and survival instincts as well as their personal pleasure, I know that killing myself would be painless as I know some fast and good methods. I also don't care much about what impact it would have on my friends, family and society as I won't be there to regret anything (I don't believe in gods or afterworlds, to me these are just stuff that humans invented because they couldn't believe that we are pointless and just a complete coincidence)
I was wondering what could I do before I decide to take my final step towards death, I am ready to die anytime, it doesn't matter a lot to me anyway but I'd like to have a little fun before that happens.
I've been watching a lot of anime, playing some video games and making stuff lately, however, I feel like I haven't experienced something that make people want to stay alive longer
I've already kissed a girl but I never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex, I failed my last two trimesters at school, I could get good grades if I worked a lot but I feel like it's not worth it, I feel like if I work hard or not, it won't change anything, I'm still going to die, I just want to have fun, to do what I want but there is no way I could live by doing the things I want.

I‚Äôm trying so hard to make everybody happy. I‚Äôm trying to get through college, I‚Äôve had two abortions I didn‚Äôt want because I knew nobody else would appreciate me if I didn‚Äôt. Everything I do is to make everybody else happy, and I‚Äôm sick of it.

I‚Äôm 24, I live with my parents, I‚Äôm not able to find a job, and as of ten minutes ago I‚Äôm single.

The second one, he didn‚Äôt do that as much, but I wasn‚Äôt as depressed. I guess I was just used to it.

I think I‚Äôm ready to leave now. After he said he‚Äôd leave me for his ex I just thought... I‚Äôve never thought to joke about that, I‚Äôve never thought of leaving him for my ex, how can he sit there and joke like that if it isn‚Äôt true?

2576,"Anyone else realize how messed up Timmy Turner‚Äôs life was? Looking back, this is quite possibly the saddest show I‚Äôve ever watched. 

His parents were either gone, or not liking him. I.e. their distrust in him when he says Vicky is rude to him. They also regularly make jokes about how much they dislike having had him. His only teacher quite literally was insane. Not only that, this teacher had a profound disliking for Timmy. He‚Äôs also bullied in school, both by his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and the person the show actually identifies as a bully. Lastly, the person who does take care of him most of the time, Vicky, is quite possibly a psychopath. 

It gets to the point where he creates a construct in his mind that he has fairies. These fairies can solve every problem Timmy has, it‚Äôs everything Timmy has ever *dreamed* of. Sometimes things get so bad, they take him to another world (that fairy world thing) They quite literally blind him from his dark reality, as they bring him to another dimension, make him a superhero, get rid of his bullies, give him a girlfriend, all the things he could *imagine* they brought to him. 

Did you ever think that maybe the reason he can‚Äôt show Cosmo and Wanda to other people, isn‚Äôt because they would be taken away, but because they don‚Äôt exist? Think about it, his parents, his teacher, everyone constantly gives him weird looks, treats him like he‚Äôs lost it, treats him like he‚Äôs a ‚Äúnot all there‚Äù 5 year old. Maybe the reason the teacher hates fairies so much, isn‚Äôt because he just doesn‚Äôt like them, but because the ‚Äúfairies‚Äù Timmy is always talking to are the sole reason he doesn‚Äôt try in school. 

Toward the end of the show, his parents get him a dog. Now, if you‚Äôre the parent to a 13 year old you‚Äôre not just going to give them a dog that they need to take care of all on their own. You‚Äôd only get them a dog if the child ABSOLUTELY needs it. In Timmy‚Äôs case, the dog is likely just a therapy dog, who the parents got for Timmy thinking it could help him return to reality.

2580,"How can I get over other people's opinion ? The only thing that keeps me from committing suicide is others' opinion about me !I want to commit suicide for various reasons:
 
  1. I'm in Medical school which I hate. Do not tell me ""it's going to get better"" - It won't ( and either way, I've run out of patience to wait for it ). Do not tell me ""you can choose something else"" - I can't, I invested time and energy into this and I am no good at anything else ( and I'm not brilliant at this either, so fuck it ). 

  2. I had an arguing with my parents. I know damn well that being 23 years old and living with them is a shame, but they just make me to feel even worse about it, even though they know I can't move out, because I have no money. Yeah, I could take out a loan and then spend the rest of my life working like a mad horse to pay back the loan. Thanks,  but no thanks. If this is life, I'd rather be dead and end up in I don't-give-a-fuck-where, whether hell does exist or not, I just don't give a damn, this crap is not worth living. 

  3. I didn't have a great adolescence at all. The first part of it was spend being a perfectionist, emotionally liable pathetic creature that I was, struggling to do well in school, because this was the only thing that mattered to my mom, plus struggling with my eating disorders all the time. The second part of it was me rebelling against my fucked-up family life: abusing alcohol and hanging out with other fucked-up people like me. Fast-forward and I'm 23, being in Medical school, studying things that I don't like, which is not a surprise, because for whatever reason I can't enjoy anything in my life at all anymore ( probably my brain is already fucked because of years of abuse ). 

  So there it is: I don't want to be a burden for my parents anymore and I can't think of anything else to figure out the shit I'm in and I've tried a lot of things. I tried working out, I was a gym member for 4 fucking years, you know what I got ? Even more body-image issues. 

  Also there is nothing motivating about the future either: in this world it's all about making good connections and licking people's asses, this is how you get ahead and so what's the point of it ? What's the point of this whole life , if I don't like anything at all about it anymore ?  I don't like the way things work, I don't like how this whole fucking world works, and because I know I'm not going to be the one who is going to change the world, I might just as well check-out, because I really don't want to fit in this society.

  I want to commit suicide, I just don't want to think about what other people will think after I die. It's kind of ironic, but this is the only thing that is holding me back. These idiots are going to talk about me even after I'm dead and I can't stand the idea of it. So tell me, if you are an average, normal person: how much people gossip about someone after they die ? What things they say about them ? Do they consider them cowards ? ",suicide

I'll just quickly say that I developed social phobia in the 7th grade. Since I shied away from everyone, I had no friends (besides my brother's friends who were only my friends because of my brother) all the way through high school. I get to college and run into the same problems. I never admitted it to myself until recently, but I've had severe depression/apathy for a very long time.

I no longer have social phobia, but I can't bring myself to show my personality. I've shown less and less of my personality as the years have gone by to the point that I'm now a complete fucking weirdo. And this isn't just around strangers and acquaintances I'm talking about; this is around my own brother and my cousin who is basically my sister. I can't be myself or show myself to anyone. I've recently tried 'practicing' by myself and trying to figure who I fucking am anymore and I don't like what I see and hear.

I took shrooms about two weeks ago and now instead of bottling everything away in pure apathy, I now care like a normal person. And I just want to die...even though I of course don't actually want to die. I want to be happy and comfortable being myself around people, but since I can't do that and will never be able, I want to die.

And I'm freaking out. I constantly have this terrible feeling in my stomach like I'm about to give a speech to a crowd of over 1000 people (and just giving a short presentation in class is one of my least favorite things in the world)... and it won't go away.

A friend talked me out of it once, but I'm too awkward and cowardly to admit to him that I'm not fine this time. I don't want to drop hints because I consider it attention whoring. I mean, if others do it, that's okay. They deserve help.



If anyone asked me what was wrong months ago, I would have had a ton of reasons to wish it, but didn't want to do it. Now I have no reason to wish it, but I want it more than ever. This is why I can't even ask for help... I have nothing to say. Well, aside from school.

Still, if I don't want help, I want the easy way out.



I guess I have walking depression, but I can still laugh and smile all day. The only thing stopping me is the fear of the afterlife: if it exists, I go to hell and I'm fucked. If it doesn't exist, I just wasted what isn't even half of my life and prematurely plunged into the eternal void. I don't feel sad, but I don't want to live either. If you gave me a gun a week ago, I would have pulled the trigger. I don't know if my friends still like me, I'm probably annoying.

2624,"hanging in there for too longI made some mistakes, and managed to run from the consequences. I ran because I was afraid, afraid of what would happen, afraid of what I would lose. Now I am afraid of what it would do to people I care about. Every time in the past few years I've gotten down enough to contemplate suicide, I've taken steps to deal with the consequences. And every time a new milestone I set to fix everything is passed, I realize how little effect it had, I'm no better off than I was before.

I'm living a triple life. I never tell anyone everything, so at best the people closest to me only have a partial view of what is going on. But I can't do it to them to tell them, that is unacceptable. I will not tolerate the loss, nor would I manipulate the loss away. I refuse to.

But yeah, now my last ditch effort is holding thumbs for the next two hours or so. If things work out, then maybe I will make it through this month, but only to have to face problems next month. Next month's already going to be harder.

If things don't work out. Well, I don't know yet. It's not like I'm going to kill myself, that takes planning and resources I just can't afford right now.

I have no clue what it feels like to have someone love me. I could give up all my money and possessions to live on the streets and be happy as long as I had someone by my side, but I will never have that. I am just working so I can eat when I am able to. I am so depressed that I force myself to eat once a day, sometimes every other day.

I did meet someone this year that I thought hey maybe she might like me. She was a kind single mother of two. I helped her out when I could. Things like her car broke down so I drove two hours to fix it. When it died i bought a PT cruiser that was in rough shape from a buddy, I spent 2 months fixing it up for her.... Well anyway none of that matters. Now she is with someone else. I am yet again forgotten.

2630,"Never happyI used to be so happy when I was a child in school. My imagination was so big that I forgot everything else along with my bestfriend during that time. But time changed as I got older... I woke up when I was around 12 years old. It was all about girls, education and success all of sudden and I didnt understand it. I began feeling unhappy and have been it ever since. Im 21 btw. I was always the ""clown"" who made all my friends laugh and I laughed myself on the outside. But inside I was crying... I felt alone and unhappy. I had friends and a bestfriend yes. But I was still completely alone once I walked home to my house playing video games. When I got older I began loosing my friends and became more an outsider in my school. They invited me to parties but I began making lies to skip it and so I spend so many weekends alone.  *I have missed out on so many epic parties,* I have missed out so many epic parties and experiences because of my shyness and lies. As I went to highschool it got worse. I only saw my classmates in school and to a few parties. I was still the funny guy though but that was all. During senior some in my class begin making fun of me for never having talked to a girl before. I just laughed with them. But deep inside it was another knife to my heart of all the failures I have made. I realised I will never get to experience what my friends experienced. The normal social life, always spending time with the guys, going out and hooking girls. After I graduated I lost all contact with them cuz I skipped them. Im an selfish asshole and that have destroyed my life.

Now I am on the edge of suicide. I dont fit in this world. I make jokes of everything and make people laugh. But the only person who doesnt laugh is myself. Where is the joy? Where is my succes? Where is my happiness?  

But I have accepted reality and find that hope was only a peaceful illusion.... Now acceptance, still lost and no idea where next... Am I happy? Never. That's just another illusion, I'm conscious of reality....for now, that's enough but not for long..... ",suicide
2631,"Constantly feeling stressed, suicidal, and anxiety-ridden. I'VE HAD ENOUGH, SOMEONE FUCKING STOP THIS.So, this is probably going to turn into a wall of text but I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

I guess this started about a year ago when I had my first panic attack at 16. It was horrible, and I've never really recover from that and I've been constantly in a downwards spiral. My anxiety is constant throughout the day, for all that time, never truly giving me a break. Sometimes its manageable when I'm in the my room during the daytime, but anywhere else it's a fucking painful cancer. Even things like movies and themeparks make me want to cry and puke from anxiety. Sometimes I get lucky and I get a couple minutes burst of endorphins, but those are quick and only put the anxiety in the background. Everything is just so difficult to do now.

This anxiety has caused worse and worse mental health. My memory and focus is completely shot because I can't sleep at night (typing this at 3 A.m). I can't even get to sleep unless there's sunlight coming in, causing me to be in a vicious cycle of sleeping from 4 A.M to 12 P.M. I've tried so much to get me back to normal but my body simply will not cooperate. If I go to bed at 9 P.M I'll wake up a hour later in a sweat and bursting with energy I can't use.. It's exhausting and I had it. I just want to have a normal sleeping pattern of 11 P.M- 8 A.M.

My appetite is out of control. I'm not hungry during the day and starving during the night. I hate it so fucking much. 

Over the past six months self-harm and suicidal thoughts are becoming worse. My day is bombarded with thoughts of hanging myself, throwing myself down the stairs, and chocking myself out. Now sometimes when I close my eyes I see a grotesque image. I'ts becoming more and more frequent.

I don't have any friends and I'm going insane from that. My parents are completely emotionally unavailable and useless. Every time I bring it up, I get stepped on ignored. They constantly keeping me on a leash, refusing to let me out of the house until they so decree. I don't even have a single fucking friend. How the hell does a fucking teenager now have any friend how the hell could some be that stupid jesus fucking christ. My only grace is I found a job and can get out of the house part-time. There's nobody around to help.

This is causing me so many problems. Every day feels exhausting and terrifying. Nothing feels real anymore. My emotions and thoughts are clashing like waves. My brain just won't fucking stop being so mean. I'm woozy and faintish whenever I stand up. I don't have motivation to game or write anymore, which I used to love. Everything just hurts me now.

I honestly just want to die and get this the hell over with, I just want rest. I just want everything to stop. I'm so fucking honestly and helpless and so far gone I don't know I would even want to live if I got better. This has been the worst year and my fucking life and hopefully the last. ",suicide

2647,"Am I alone in feeling this way?Hi all. I joined reddit only to come here and reach out. I feel pretty lonely and I really just want to know if there are other people that have a similar experience. I am not actively suicidal or in danger to myself, but I've been struggling a lot. 

I'm a teenager, and it's been six weeks since I got discharged from a residential treatment program, and I've been having a really hard time. I've never had a ""real"" suicide attempt, but I've been depressed and anxious for a long time, and I've lived with suicidal ideation since I was 10. My family has been abusive in the past. I didn't realize this was the case until very late into my treatment at residential which has been very difficult because I came home with a lot of unresolved issues. 

I've been in every level of care, and because I was steadily declining, I was put into a residential treatment facility. I also needed 24 hour care due to how nonfunctional I was. When I got there I realized that most of my peers in the facility had attempted suicide. I have had suicidal actions, such as writing letters/notes, collecting pills, figuring out ways to end my life, starting to attempt, etc. Ever since I got into treatment, my resolve to actually attempt has gotten stronger and stronger. I'm very afraid that my pain isn't valid unless I've tried to kill myself. That narrative has been cycling through my mind for a few years, and now I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. 

There have been many, many times when I've been actively suicidal, or at least gotten to being ""truly suicidal"", meaning I really, really wanted to die. As in, that's all I wanted out of life. When I was residential I really wanted to kill myself and I tried 3 times, but none of them worked because I didn't have what I actually wanted to use, which was really frustrating at the time.

 The other odd thing I've realized is that I wasn't attempting outside of treatment because I lived by staying in bed all day, sleeping all day, or watching youtube all day. That meant I didn't have to actually think about why I was in pain, so I stayed in limbo of numbing the pain and constantly getting caught in it. I guess it was my only way of keeping my suffering at bay. But then when I actually had to think about the pain or why I was in pain, the suicidal thoughts became rampant. It also doesn't help that when I'm not suicidal or when I'm having a good day, that ""I'm not sick enough"" narrative is there. So when I'm actually actively suicidal where I want to die, that narrative adds even more resolve as to why I ""need"" to kill myself. 

But I'm afraid of being seen as wanting attention. That's the exact opposite of what I want. It's really hard to attempt at home because 1) I don't want my family to know 2) I don't want people to find out and worry 3) I don't want to get hospitalized again 4) I don't want to talk about with anyone, or talk about the emotions behind it. 

It's weird, because when I'm not actually suicidal, I'm thinking all the time about wanting to attempt suicide to prove I'm in pain, or that my pain is valid. But when I'm actually suicidal where I want to die to end the pain, then the ""you need to prove it"" just feels like an added reinforcer, even if that's not the primary reason I want to die. But then again, isn't it kind of fucked up that my baseline is ""I need to prove I'm in pain by risking my life and/or dying""?

I don't know, maybe I'm looking for reassurance, maybe I'm looking for someone to relate. It's odd. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this, and I haven't, so I'm still trying. I'm still reaching out. But it's just so hard.

2655,"Irreversible problemIn general I've had an alright life. I've got friends, I'm generally liked by those who take the time to get to know me, I have a supportive mother and family, I became successful in a career I wanted to pursue from just my own enthusiasm, fincally alright off and I had a loving, caring and stunningly beautiful girlfriend who I shared so much in common and wanted to spend my life with, as did she.

Everything changed when my girlfriend took her life.

During our two year relationship she'd been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder, I tried to get her support and help and in ways she seemed to be getting better.
The problems certainly put a strain on our relationship and left me emotionally and mentally exhausted at times, but I stuck by her because she was worth it. 

Among the many reasons she may have taken her life I know she was very scared about me being away for a new contract as I'd been gone for the weekdays and even with me trying to reassure her I believe her abandonment issues overwhelmed her. 

Since it happened everything has just spiralled. Her mother blamed me and started to spread lies about me resulting in people turning against me. It's put immense strain on my relationship with my mother as she witnesses me lose my will to live. I had to leave the job as I could no longer face it and lost all passion for the career I once enjoyed so much.

The main thing above all else is how I've lost her and I can't fathom or face a life without her. She was just too special, too loving, too beautiful and no one will ever live up to her. I feel like I failed her by moving away and none of this would've happened had I just stayed.

I'm 32, I've spent most of my adult life single due to my crippling shyness and anxeity. It was almost a mircale that a girl like her was interested in a guy like me and I feel in ways I blew it for not making her feel more special and taking her for granted.

It's been over half a year since it happened and I'm just getting worse. Even with therapy, grief counselling, medication and endless research I'm not improving. I won't meet another and even if somehow I did they would never compare. 

I don't really want to die but again, I can't face a reality without her. I find myself spending more time now just getting ready to end it, getting the confidence to do it. I get no joy from anything, I just cry and spend all day in bed. Not even sure why posting this, I guess it's just somewhere to vent. ",suicide

care.Note: I have been in a depression for a long time. Opened up about it about a year ago. Saw almost all of my friends leave me, one by one when I wasn't useful anymore. I lost my job, got expelled from university for failing to write my final thesis and had to move back to my parents basement. I had one friend left, my best friend, or so I thought. She didn't stay in contact and neither did I much. I wrote two e-mails but that's that. I had hoped she'd care about me even when I wasn't around to do things for her. She didn't. When I hadn't heard from her in two months I wrote to her wishing her well for the future. I thought that it had ended and wanted to at least tell her that I am proud of her for having finished university and all. She replied that she had put her head in the sand instead of writing me and she was sorry. And then she asked if I had my degree and what I was doing now. And I...well...I kinda broke. I told her that I hadn't gotten my degree because, as I told her, I was kicked out. And that quite frankly I have nothing ""exciting to share"" because I was trying not to kill myself and it was pretty hard. I also replied that I knew that I didn't have much to offer in terms of conversations and that it was okay if she didn't want to reply.

And well she didn't. I don't know, I was probably too harsh to her and there is nothing she can do anyway. I am just a burden for everyone and why would she want to talk to me? It's just hard knowing that apart from your parents there isn't a single person who cares. I guess I am wondering if I should try to apologize, get her a present and ask her to forgive me because I really really owe it to my parents not to kill myself and it's just harder when you have no social network at all.

Whenever I'm with her I feel butterflies and when she smiles at me the world stands still, she makes me feel like the happiest guy alive and I genuinely care for her and don't want her to get hurt in any way, in case you're wondering she has told me that she feels the same way about me.

We were texting eachother when she pretty much disappeared for half a hour, when she came back she sent a snap of her hand bandaged up, she has had self harm issues before, just like me, a month or so earlier we swore to each other that we won't do it anymore for each other. I asked her what happened and she told me a bit unbelievable story.

Then she asked me when she wanted me to lose my virginity, to which I replied ""whenever you feel ready, making you do something you're not comfortable with is the last thing I want to do"". She then asked ""what if I won't be ready?"", I replied ""you'll know when you're ready"".

Then out of nowhere she texted me ""I know that would be a reason for you to leave me"", I replied that I would never leave her. She started telling me that she wouldn't fulfill my needs and I would need someone else. I told her that all I would ever want is just to be with her and that having sex is not the point of the relationship.",non-suicide

2685,"A very tough lifeName's Michael, a youngling, 18, living in Costa Rica, University of Costa Rica Law School first year student. My father died recently. My father was my guide, my best friend, my mischievous buddy, we did everything together. He died of liver cancer on the hours between 11pm of Feb 12 and 1am Feb 13, I was woken up by my worried girlfriend (we were  in a call and was woken up by the same thing) and my mother screaming and pleading for mercy
I didn't have a chance to see my father when he was hospitalized up until the day of his death, mere hours before it happened. He was drugged, only way through stop his unrelenting rebellious spirit that prevented him from staying in bed. Only thing I could get to say was that I had finally entered into law school, his dream come true, he was so happy. He wanted to kiss me, but he couldn't, he was too high. I kissed him instead, and begged him to stay still. I promised him I'd tell him more once he was out of the hospital. He replied to me with a particular set of words in Spanish he would always say to me ""ok, Mijo"" high and not willing to let me go but still letting me go because he understood I was uncomfortable. How I wish I hadn't.
How I wish he was still alive, still with me, still smiling and talking to me about his job in the private air charter flights company he administrated
Life without him is so hard, it's almost not worth living

Almost.
I still cling onto my now ex girlfriend. She has BPD, and I myself am not at my 100% sanity levels. She still loves me, so she claims. But during two months past my father's death, I treated her badly. I would be cold and edgy, saying things like nothing mattered in the end not even her, seeking help from anyone and anything that'd be willing to help me feel better, this worsened our situation, and long story short, we broke up. After nearly a year of full commitment, and 7 months of nothing but what we both wanted, a relationship 100% us and no one else, we broke up. I hurt her to the point where her entire body and life tells her not to come back to me. She keeps saying she wants to be better and healthier before we date again, as she also has cancer. A little detail I didn't mention before, that holds some importance. I always tried my best to take care of her as much as I could, even in her darkest times. It seems as though it's an excuse to gwork on herself and become independent and forget about me though. I'm soon to be diagnosed with ADHD as my therapist said I met all criteria but prefered I went to a psychiatrist for a Dx. So maybe that plays a part in the way I see things, and I sure hope it is
But then again
Sometimes she'll come to me and give me all that love, and sometimes it just seems as though she's tired of even talking to me. 
My mother and other family members know me as the smart yet extremely quite kid. Not to make a joke and a stereotype about autism but, you know the kind. They expect so much from me, but I'm failing class, I'm failing my father, I failed to take care of him. My actions got him killed. I could've saved him.
My actions also ended a relationship both parties had invested tons into, and now I cling onto the idea that we will one day be back together, even though sometimes it seems like a straight off lie. But I've lost so much already, I've destroyed my entire life.
If she confirms my doubts and leaves, nothing will stop me from wanting to od, no matter how many things are pointed out, people that love me, things like that. Nothing works, I simply want out, and I don't know why I can't just feel okay again, this year has taken everything from me; even my will to live.",suicide

My Me Mission Services LLC has always been a very personal company that helped individuals one-on-one to improve their lives. Lately, we've decided to open a blog in order to reach and help people on a much more grand scale.

Suicidal thoughts is a real problem that many people face. Over the last two years, we've helped dozens of suicidal men and women improve their lives and reduce their suicidal tendencies.

A huge component of the mentality of many suicidal people is the feeling that they are alone. Many feel that the problems they're dealing with are unique when most are very common. In order to show this, we would like to interview (formerly) suicidal men and women and share their stories in the Stories section of our blog. We not only want to help people know that they are not alone, we want to share real world examples of how others in their situation have curved those thoughts and improved their lives.

You can choose to make your identity confidential in the way you want. If you're in Las Vegas, we can interview you in person and you have the option to have your video interview posted.

Just send me a DM/PM and we can set something up.

Some people like me and call me their friend. I don‚Äôt know if their standards are super low or what, but I wish I had the heart to tell them how much I appreciate the fact they like me. I wish they would ignore me and go for better friends but at the same time, it feels like a knife going through my chest when I see them talk to other people, as if I‚Äôm selfish and need approval, even if it won‚Äôt do much.

I get jealous when I see the men around me. They‚Äôre confident and responsible. I was beaten a lot by my uncles as a kid. I can tell one of them feels remorse over his actions since he‚Äôs been too nice over the years, trying to buy me expensive things and whatever. 

The abuse ripped apart every inch of manhood I had. I wasn‚Äôt strong, I wasn‚Äôt dignified and I wasn‚Äôt brave. I‚Äôve bonded more with my sisters than any other men I‚Äôve met in my life. They understood the abuse as they had gone through it as well, however they could be a bit stoic at times. 

Because of the abuse, I‚Äôve grown to not trust many people and be extremely anxious and shy 24/7. I hear my family members, schoolmates, etc talk about how I lack ambition, how I‚Äôm too reserved and feminine, how I‚Äôm not as good as the other kids. Sorry I can‚Äôt speak in a room full of people, sorry if my face flushes red when my name is called, sorry I feel more comfortable being alone for days than visiting some of the family but it‚Äôs your fault for sitting back there and supporting the abuse when I was younger. Every time I took one step too far, I‚Äôd be threatened as you thought it was a good way to control me.

My father died when I was 4 and I was vulnerable. Beating and threatening me with violence are the two things you should definitely not be doing... All those punches that were thrown, tears I‚Äôve shedded and lashes from your belts were for no benefit. And even then, my father probably wouldn‚Äôt have treated me any nicer had he still been alive at that point. 

I‚Äôm the runt of the family now. I‚Äôm stupid, weak, shy and not manly enough. Why can‚Äôt I be more like my fucking doctor aunts or lawyer uncles?! I‚Äôd kill myself if I didn‚Äôt have two sisters and a few friends who care. I‚Äôm happy for my sisters, but their success still hurts...

She was seeing somebody else but kissed me before I told her I needed some time. Then she never told me she was in a relationship and let me believe I was taking her out on a date over the weekend. It was only after I had kissed her that she told me she had a boyfriend. Despite that we went out for dinner and she held my hand and cuddled into my arm, crying a lot because she wants to be with me but she says 'she can't'. I took her home and she begged me to stay the night, to which I responded that it wouldn't be right. She told me 'we don't have to do anything, we can just cuddle', which to me implied she wanted more to happen. I wanted more to happen too but I left because I knew it would've hurt more if we slept together and she still couldn't be with me.

Haven‚Äôt showered in a week (usually one every two days is my schedule), house is a mess for the last 2 months (haven‚Äôt cleaned once) and I feel truly bad. I don‚Äôt want to live anymore NOT because I see no hope for my future (I do, truly) but because I feel like even on my happiest days, I will struggle with depression and even the idea is making me exhausted. Almost like I am completely taken over by darkness but here is the thing.. I will never kill myself even though I want to stop existing everyday. Everyday I wish I wasn‚Äôt present in this world; feeling, thinking... but I will never kill myself because I have an extreme fear of death (Thanatophobia). I was brought up atheist so I never had an afterlife concept, no hell or heaven, just darkness. I think it was this that caused me to have a fear of death from a young age. I used to have panic attacks thinking about death at the ages of 9-10. This never went away and I carried it to my adulthood as well. Thanatophobia is not only causing me to stay alive, but it is also feeding my depression. I simply cannot make peace with the knowledge of all will come to an end someday. And I will not be the one to determine which day that will be. So, this is not hopeful, this is not positive. This is not me saying ‚ÄúI will stay alive because I want to.‚Äù This is me saying fear has a big role in me being alive and it is a type of torture everyday of the week, constantly.",suicide
2755,"I'm confused.I'm thinking about suicide everyday about two years. I think I will never try it because I afraid to die, but the idea of suicide gives me chill... and sometimes it seems like the only way... 

things are getting worse every day where I live. almost everyone I met is stupid, unreliable and angry. I hate to talking people except my family, in fact I don't even talk with my family because they always find to say things that makes me angry. it just makes me sick. but I have to survive. I'm not working since I graduated from college. I need money. I can't live like this forever. I have to communicate with those people. I have to work with them. even this idea scares me, not like social phobia or something else, I just don't want to do it. it always surprises me that how I graduated from those schools without any nervous breakdown. except the fake friends, I was always alone and I can say that my most beautiful years gone wasted, and it was just because of this two faced society. they were/they are hypocrite and abusive every topic you can imagine. I preferred to stay away for not to get any harm, but it wasn't enough. they broke my heart a lot. and I know nothing gonna change about them.

I know what I don't want to do, but I don't know what else I can do.  even if I decide what I'm gonna do, the place where I live  won't give me any chance. and the time is running out. I'm looking at people around me, on the internet... and they don't think deep. they don't even think. all they do is talking about themselves, talking about their endless problems...

I love this life. I love breathing, my eyes, my ears, every part of my body works just fine. but somehow, it's not enough. it can't stop the things going through my head. sometimes I'm planning every single detail, and sometimes the idea comes like "" hey, jump from there. it's gonna be fine"".

2762,"I have lost my desire to live and want to dieHello, I'm not sure where to start, but I am just going to start typing to put the thoughts in my head down in some sort of unorganized manner.  I apologize in advance for my poor grammar and scattered thought process.  I'm currently drunk while typing this after finding out my ex has moved on to another person.  I'm watching football, and that used to make me very happy. I don't care about it today. I'm severely depressed. I don't want to be alive any longer. The only things that keep me going are the fact that I have a wonderful dog who would be devastated and without a home if I passed away, and my mom would be devastated if I passed away.  

I have no job, no potential employment, about $15,000 in student loan debt, a $223 per month car payment, I'm expected to pay $890 at the end of the month for rent, I no longer have health insurance, and I don't have enough to cover those bills in the bank. My ex-girlfriend who was an absolute gift in my life that I never deserved left me a few months ago due to my chronic abuse of marijuana and alcohol on a daily basis, and I am completely unable to get over it. I dream about her a couple times a week, and while I'm awake, the poor decisions that I made while we were in a relationship are daily reminders to me about how shitty of a person I am.  When I dream about her, we are happy, but when I wake up, reality hits me and I'm sad when I wake up almost every morning/afternoon.  She was wonderful and treated me more kindly than any other person I've known.  On top of that, she is absolutely beautiful from head to toe and inside out. She's the only woman I've ever met that doesn't compromise her morals for other people or situations.  I became too much of a burden on her life, and she left me when she went to study abroad in September of this year.  

I've been thinking about killing myself for years, and I don't own a firearm for the fear that I would use it on myself in a moment of complete depression and sadness. 

Since I was a child I was told that I had ADHD, and I was put on a regiment of Ritalin, Concerta, or Adderall (sorry if they are spelled wrong), and I think that's what began my addictive lifestyle. I have quit smoking, but I drink at least 5 days a week. When I'm not drinking, I often think about drinking. I'm unorganized, have months of mail that deals with bills and unpaid taxes and such.  I'm messy and don't know where to start to fix things, so I just ignore them.  My mother is a hoarder, and many of those tendencies have become my own as I grow older.  I hate that about me. I hate most things about me. I often find myself wishing that I had cancer or some debilitating disease so that I have an excuse as to why I feel as hopeless and sad as I do. I keep everything hidden from my family and friends. I justify it by telling myself that I don't want to be a reason for them to be unhappy. I would much rather see and make them happy than bring them down with the problems that plague my mind on a daily basis.  

As far as the things that make me happy go, they are few.  I have recently begun coaching volleyball for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. I'm not fully qualified yet, so I don't get paid, but coaching is an absolute joy for me. When I coach, all my problems melt away and I'm focused on the issues at hand which are teaching the girls on how to be better at volleyball.  I currently help out an elderly gentleman with his teams because I'm 27 and able to do much more than he is when it comes to the physical demands of coaching.  I am in the process of becoming a qualified coach, but I'm dragging my feet, so to speak, for some reason.  

Today I am thinking about ending my life more than any other.  I have already chosen the place that I would like to do it so as to decrease the shock upon people and family as much as possible.  I have already begun writing the letters and thinking out what I want to say to the people who would be directly affected by my abrupt death.  This post is quite possibly my last outcry to try and save my life.  I have lost every desire to even wake up in the morning. I'm am bombarded and reminded of my problems from financial to emotional as soon as I wake up each day, so that makes me not want to wake up anymore.  

On a daily, and sometimes hourly basis, I remind myself of how much of a loser/failure I am. I have had so many opportunities for further education and employment pass me by, and I feel like there isn't much hope left for me.  I can't make enough money to pay my bills even when I do become a fully qualified volleyball coach so that I can be paid.  I no longer desire to be happy because after my somewhat momentary happiness ends there is always the crippling reminder by my mind of the actual situation that I find myself in.  

I appreciate anyone who reads this as my last outcry to salvage any type of productive/happy life that I might have.  If you can't make a difference in my life, I don't blame you. Most likely I will be dead in a few weeks once the New Years rolls around.  That's my plan at least. 

I view myself as completely undesirable and unwanted from birth to adulthood. I am largely a burden from financial reasons to emotional reasons to the people/family that are involved in my life. 

I could use some help. I want to die, but I want to live at the same time. Life is hard, and I don't know how to function properly as an adult.  If you are reading this for the first time in 2017, then just ignore it because i am most likely already dead.  

Thank you to anyone who has spent their time reading this rambling of thoughts and emotions.  I hope you have a happier life than I have and make more constructive decisions than I have.  I don't believe in God, so I have no hope for the afterlife.  I may fall sleep soon. I've had about 6 shots of vodka since I began writing this.

Thank you, and I'm sorry to burden your life with my problems.   ",suicide

Buddy B doesn't even like hip hop, I do and live 10 minutes away from buddy A but they like each other. I don't have that with anyone.

""Get hobbies"" I have multiple social and socialish hobbies

""volunteer"" I have done in the past but with my hobbies, university and work I don't have time at the moment

It doesn't make a difference because I'm still the same boring old me no matter where I go.

I've been to social skills classes, I've tried to invite people out only to receive silence or rejection. I've read book after book and watched Ted talk after Ted talk. I suck at conversations, thinking of things to say. I'm probably an energy drain without realising it. I don't want to wait for ""ThE OnE"" in a romantic sense. I'm lonely and don't want to live like this anymore. What's the point of working hard for money and then Is suicide only a depression thing? Why can't it be a logical choice?

Maybe I'm a damn alien I can't connect with people. Even when I think I've clicked with a person it means nothing to them.

Maybe people can smell desperation but i don't know what else to do. I'm normally one to try to fix an issue instead of complain but I'm done.  I want to spend time with people.

I am 24-year-old introvert guy, who has emigrated to Australia recently. I am kinda introvert and have some can be considered as close friends. I have gone through a lot of things, including working in many underpaid jobs just to support my life here and finally got my permanent residency. I was so proud of that, even more when i got a job as accountant in a small accounting firm. However like they said ""the higher you climb, the harder you fall"", when i lost my job recently since my company was undergoing some major changes in their structure and there would be no more work that i could do, i am feeling so depressed and can't help the thought of being incompetent to keep the job. I've been trying to apply for another jobs but receive just rejection letters so far. Today it is even worse when my manager in my current underpaid part time job (where i've been working for nearly 3 years) said she was pissed when seeing me working so slow and wanted to fire me but would give me another two weeks to see how i would do. It was a huge shock since I didn't know what was just going on.
My career is just in no where and even a underpaid labour job that I couldn't keep. I don't know how incompetent i can be.
 Now i am in a place far away from home, can't talk to my family since I don't want them to worry sick about me and can't talk to my friends since they have too much to worry already.

I've tried one shoddy attempt at suffocating myself once with a plastic bag and rope, but that was it so far. I do fantasize about it all the time, daily, even as I type this. I tried to talk to my dad about it  several times, but he thinks its just bullshit. I talked to my sister about it a lot, but she always seemed to just brush it off because  she went through a depressive streak and slashed her wrists, but got over it somehow. 


She went and had a kid with an abusive drug addicted criminal, and now she is going through a nasty custody battle with him. I am being supportive, listening to her, being understanding, reassuring her, basically just trying to help her out as best as I can, and not stress her out. I also help her pay for some minor things and help babysit my nephew, as well go to court with her to give her a moral boost. She moved back in with me and our abusive parents, and I tried my damn hardest to make sure they focused most of their crap on me instead of her. She was only able to last a month with them. 


So we go to court last week, nothing really happens but the crazy guy's lawyer scares the shit out of my sister, so she calls me hysterically crying saying she wants kill herself. I somehow manage to calm her down and cheer her up pretty quickly, we talk some more, and she hangs up. And now here is the problem, ever since that phone call I get extremely angry when I get my suicidal thoughts. It's like those thoughts have been a comforting thing for me, something I could control. When now I can't think about them, because if I go and off myself my sister and nephew will have no one to help them. Anyone have any advice? This shit makes my angry just typing it.

My drivers test got postponed and I couldn‚Äôt get out of a deep emotional rut for a while. 
Around June however things were looking up. I had completed PT at this point and was able to go lifting again, I took my drivers test, passed and got a job the next day. I bought the truck I have now and have been working on it and making it a great vehicle, I‚Äôm doing decently in school and have made a lot of friends through work.

2826,"I'll never be as happy as I was when I was littleI just don't feel like I see any point in anything anymore if I can't be happy. 

I don't really know where to start, or what I'm doing, but here I go.

I'm very shy and private-I think I always have been- and I don't ever feel really comfortable talking to people I'm not really familiar with. Even online, I'm pretty much always a lurker. As a result, I only have a handful of people I feel like I can go to when I'm feeling depressed. And I just feel like I bring the people I love down all the time. I'm so needy but I have nothing to offer. I'm like a child and I don't understand why I even have the few friends I do.

My dog is dying. He has a cancerous lump that's enormous, and has been growing for about a year and a half now. I know not everyone will understand, and I'm not trying to equate this with losing a human being, but losing my dog is really, really hard. He's been my constant friend since I was 3 years old (I'm 19 now), he moved with me from one country to another, and he's always been so gentle and sweet. I know he'll be gone soon and I'm trying so hard to prepare myself but today on the train I finally just started crying. I imagined what it would be like never to get to hug him again and it was torture. I'm away from home right now so I'm sitting here in my dorm hugging my stuffed animal like an infant pretending its him.

On top of it, my anxiety has gotten out of control. I've always had it but I think college has made it much, much worse. I'm very rarely cheerful. I'm happiest when I imagine what I want my future to be like. Silly things like pretending I'm best friends with Quentin Tarantino or that I write for the Daily Show. I feel like my imagination has been able to sustain me for 19 years but I'm old enough now to realize those things will probably never happen, and right now I don't feel like I have anything that makes me as happy as my stupid Mary Sue dreams that wont ever come true.

I used to want to be a writer but more and more I feel like I have nothing to say, and no motivation to try. Ironically, I really want to write comedy, because it's the stuff that's always made me happiest, but I just don't think I have the ability to make others as happy as comedy has made me. So even watching things that used to make me laugh feels painful.

There's so many things I want to do, but more and more I'm realizing I'm not nearly as special as I wish I were. Aside from being a good comfort to my mom (she's been depressed since her best friend of 36 years died a few years back) there's nothing I feel like I can do. I used to dream so big and for the past few years I've been forced to come to terms with how small I really am. And I just don't see the point of living for probably decades more if I'll never be as happy as I was when I was, like, 5 years old and going to Disney for the first time. I just don't think I'm cut out for it.

I'm sorry this is so long, and I don't really know what I want from this, I just felt the need to write something. I don't want to bother my friends anymore.",suicide

2828,"Life feels so overwhelming...Hello 

I don't even know where to start, but right now, things are really bad - or feel really bad at least. I'm aware that a lot of it has to do with how I experience it and I think this might make it worse. 

Right now, I have a week off annual leave that I've been looking forward to for months. But now we're in full lockdown again and even though I don't want to go outside (thanks to OCD), it just frustrates me that I don't really have too many options - no cinema, no restaurant visits... I understand it's necessary, but it's still hard. 

I have no family or friends nearby either. Just housemates that I don't get along with very well. Or rather, that I don't really want to talk to as that would drag me down even more.

I have a therapist, but I feel that the quality of therapy just gets worse and worse, we don't really resolve anything, we just chat. Which is nice, in a way, but it doesn't really help in the long run. She told me to contact her whenever I need to get something off my chest, but she doesn't really reply to it anymore, which kind of defies the purpose. 
I know that most therapists probably wouldn't be available 24/7, and that's understandable - but I do miss those replies she used to send, a short text or voice message, sometimes giving advice or even just to acknowledge it. 

She pretty much is the only person I can talk to. My family would just tell me to get my stuff together. 

I do have a best friend, but she seems very distant recently too. Maybe it's the situation as a whole, maybe some external factor, maybe I'm just such a pain? I can't even ask that as I'd be worried she would just sugarcoat  the answer (Or start to feel annoyed if I keep asking why she's so distant/if she still wants to go on holidays once it's safe to do so).

I think the only reason I'm still here is that I know deep inside that I mean... at least something to some people. Probably not as much as I wish I would, but that's something I only have so much control over. I try my best, but I can't tell what other people are thinking.

Short progolgue/rant/explanation before going into the problem: It is not my first time writting here but I will try to be short as possible since I had a really bad and am not in the mood for writting. Just to let you know that I am a woman and to give you perspective since most advices here are by men for men and it is very easy to throw around some words when it is all men. Like men have it easier because if they go to the fitness and make big muscles, half of my problems that I have as a woman will be eradicated but I as a woman can't go out there looking like a tall manly monster while men can go away with it. 

I am aware this question must have been asked a lot in the past but what I see is only advice for men, like to ""man up"" and to certain things but I do not have money or resources to do most of them so if you are a man and give me advice give it with a grain salt, knowing that I do not live in America, but in Europe, I am a woman so I can't ""grow balls"" or ""beat up everyone I want to for fun"" or ""walk around freely with a knife or a gun"" like it was suggested in some other thread I saw 

P.S. I am not in high school and it is quite offensive to think I am, so now. I am an adult. Thank you.

The problem: My life experience has shown me that it is foolish to expect everyone to be your friend and to be nice to you just because you are nice. but the solution really annoys me and scares me because I know what happens when I put it to work, everyone avoids me and calls me a bitch, yet it somehow works for everyone else. Many girls I know, the most popular girls usually were really mean, so were the boys. So my nice \*\*\* ever tries to be mean or fight back when harassed and it becomes a really big problem, either the harasser laughs at me and continues to harass me or people just avoid me because they think I am confrontational and problematic, which I am not, I do not like conflicts but staying on my \*\*\* and never calling out people who used to bully me for years has proven to not be effective. They just continue to harass me no matter if I ignore them or call them out on their behavior

My goal is to understand this whole power play dynamic and why it takes place. Does my type of personality attract bullying? I remember having problems with it all of my life. Let me explain why I had this short prologue in the beginning. The stereotypical american online does not care much about the outside world. The laws of my country are very, very different from America, yet I have had people shame me for my problems or give me horrible advice in general or both. No, life is not an action movie and I am not the karate kid, No I am not a \*insert slur\* because I can't beat up a gang of guys on steroids, No where I live it is not okay to take a knife and stab my classmates( This advice was given to me by an american high school teacher, so good job!!!) I always have to explain to my self because most people on here give bad advice but some give brilliant and great advice that works for me. I am not saying all users are like those I gave example of and I have blocked and reported these people. I can write all day long about my encounters with weird people from reddit and quora but the point is for me to get  a good advice and not whine to all of you about each detail of my life. Some males on here can't imagine the female perspective and give really terrible advices and some males on here give really good universal advices that work for me.

I am deeply flawed so I have read books on self improvement and I would dare to say that I have made small self improvement which is better than none

I had a panic attack today and yesterday, was trembling and crying and felt like I was holding a really heavy box that I couldn't let go of. After crying for an hour and a half I seemed to calm down but felt better. I mentioned in my last post that I do not know any reasons why I am alive, I do not speak about my \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* thoughts antymore because one ""apperently christian"" classmate made fun of me after I kinda shared this to her on a school trip

(I have been heavily bullied in middle and high school and have a hard time making friends)

I now have ptsd, am full of shame, guilt, grief and struggle to find any reason to live. I feel ugly and broken beyond repair and am ashamed to go to another psychologist. I feel dirtied and r\*\*\*d and do not want to marry one of those people with the male genitalia or have children yet those who bullied me probably do not remember me and will have children while I will die alone. I just want this to end but now my parents watch me because I self hurt and stopped washing when I was 16 and felt the most suicidal during 10th grade. I still get ""waves"" of desire for suicide but I find it hard to find my purpose.

I try to eradicate my onw flaws - people pleasing, needyness, clingyness, desparation(Out of need for survival, I was desperate for friends yet did not know how to make them so here it is like unwritten rule that if you are alone you will be bullied and I am very vulnerable to bullying and can't deal with it which is why I was an easy target, i couldn't defend my self and no one took me seriously and if i ever defend my self people either laughed or threatened to beat me up. I also used to be overhappy which for some weird reason unnerved people. I am not autistic or on the spectrum but I have adhd, and sometimes my anxiety and adhd, create social problems but I have never been good. 

Half of the things I read about body language and communication skills baffle me and they seem genuienely stupid (like I avoid eye contact cause to me it seemed perverted yet the dumb males think it is submissive and take it as a que to harass me, great job. ) I am tired of this world and do not know what to mold my self into anymore to survive. I am ashamed of the fact that I have trauma and have to deal with it. I have had strangers bully me and laugh at me and even old men flirting with me which made me isolate my self even more. 

Important:

I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO BE A B TO EVERYONE IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY SELF AND SURVIVE AND SHOW THE DUMB MALE GENDER THAT I AM NOT WEAK AND I AM NOT UGLY AND I DO NOT WANT OR DESERVE TO BE HARASSED AND BULLIED. If I am nice they harass me, if I am mean, they harass me. Like what is the point, they will go to the heartless pretty b anyway, so I stand no chance and do not want my life purpose to revolve around the others and expecting of them to be nice to me. I do not feel like I am safe around men, I feel like they would beat me up, and I see women as a competetion due to the hostile bullying in my past. I know guys are dumb enough to fall for literally the meanest girls when I was in school so I will no longer waste my time on them and just try to not \*\*\* my self and focus on me. I try to develop my hobbies but my mind is plauging me and I feel the need to \*\*\* my self, by either taking overdose with pills or my father's pistol and just shooting towards my heart so I would not miss. Phrases like - OOOh not all men are bad, scare me because it is a risk and 8/10 times guys are horrible so it is not wroth it. I do not want to date, marry, or have children. I want to give up on men and realize this mindset is toxic but do not feel physically safe around those with the d\*cks",suicide
2838,"Fuck this shit. I'm finally done.I'm ending it. I've been going through bullshit day in and day out every single motherfucking day of my life.

I cry every morning when I wake up, I cry during the day if I can find a place to be alone, and I cry myself to sleep every night. 

I don't have any friends. I haven't had any friends for over a year. I am sociable, but people don't want to hang out with me.

My mom is verbally and psychologically abusive. My job hates me and threatens to fire me all the time. Then I would have bills to pay that I couldn't pay. I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.

I was trying to make brownies earlier, and I spilled a little bit of chocolate on the counter. Maybe the size of a quarter. My mom went ape-shit telling me how I need to take a cooking class and calling me a ""fucking retard"" and saying, ""What did I do to deserve you as a child?"" that there's ""chocolate everywhere; all over the counter, paper towels, in the sink"" and none of this bullshit is fucking true. I am a neat freak. I'm not a slob.

I always try to not let it bother me, but fuck, it fucking bothers me enough that I've decided to end my life. If she hears me crying she says ""fuck you"" and if I continue to cry she takes my car keys away (by force, I will fight her) and take my cell phone away and probably try to choke me which she has done before.

I'm 19 years old and I already feel too old for this. I am so tired that I feel like I'm 90. I'm tearing up and so afraid to cry that it's making it harder to hold it in.

I always kinda felt bad about thinking about killing myself by thinking my family would miss me. Maybe they will, and maybe my mom will be miserable forever but now that is what I *want*. My mom always tells my family members that I am a horrible person. That I lie and steal, and that I do horrible things that I have never done in my life. She lies to their faces in front of me, and I have to get lectured every time I see them about something stupid my mom told them I did.

For weeks I've worked overtime shifts from 4:30am and again from 8pm-midnight just so we can pay bills. I literally sleep 2 non-consecutive hours each night. I'm a teacher, he hasn't been to work since the 3rd because of ""medical leave"" AKA he was hungover two days running and then has been drinking every day since. I have to fast for the next 3 weeks which is actually ok, I've done it for weeks before, but also necessary because we don't have any food. He's skinny and can't skip meals, I'm a fucking fatass which is probably partly why the only man who wanted me is a useless, horrible drunk. 

My friends have homes, have families. He's alienated me from everyone - I no longer speak to anyone in my family after one nightmarish drunken episode after another. I have no friends. I have become a drunk, too - at first it was to cope and then it was to keep him from having every drop. I spend most evenings hiding booze from him, hiding cards, hiding keys.

I‚Äôve attached myself to a group of friends which is great too, but over the past year there‚Äôs been a few times where people inside this friendship group have made some comments ‚Äúin jest‚Äù which have really hurt me. I‚Äôve tried writing it off as banter plenty of times, and I know I am oversensitive so have to write some of it off as that too, but especially recently I‚Äôve been struggling to cope more and more. 

Like this afternoon for example; I was in a perfectly happy mood having worked on my own all day, then walk into the office to complete some paperwork before I go home and three of the guys are in there. The dominant influencer of the three makes some comments dressed as ‚Äúbanter‚Äù, and instantly I feel a sense of dread. Like someone has pressed a light switch, I feel a warm queasy feeling all over my body and I feel my chest go all fluttery. I struggle not to cry in front of them and leave quickly. I won‚Äôt go into the comments made, not because they are particularly nasty or anything but it requires inside knowledge of the job I do and that would take even longer to explain. 

Anyway so I‚Äôm feeling pretty terrible about all this, and begin to have violent visualisations where I‚Äôm hurting myself, like deeply cutting into my arms or falling from a tall building and my bones smashing. I can‚Äôt stop these visions from appearing in my head and I‚Äôm almost craving the physical sensation that they depict. I do have a history of depression and low mood which stems from childhood (I‚Äôm 23 now).  In recent times these visions of me hurting myself seem to become my default response to feeling low. The violent thoughts soon progress into suicidal thoughts and I then spiral and get more &amp; more upset.

I can‚Äôt tell work how I feel because if I admit the thoughts in my head I will be taken away from the work that I love and probably end up being made to go sick which will make me feel 100x worse.

My bf knows I get sad from time to time but I don‚Äôt want to burden him with my problems because I‚Äôm scared that it‚Äôll put him off (which is pretty illogical because we live together and have been together a good while). I don‚Äôt like burdening my parents either because they‚Äôve got their own worries. 

I don‚Äôt want to confront the boy because when I‚Äôve told him before that he‚Äôs upset me I‚Äôm made to feel like the one in the wrong because I can‚Äôt handle the banter. Likewise I can‚Äôt report it to work because I don‚Äôt want to be labelled a grass, and I‚Äôve always believed I should have the courage to confront the person and if I can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt do that then I shouldn‚Äôt get anyone else involved.

I know I‚Äôm giving excuses for literally every possible solution, (and I‚Äôm sorry about that because I can‚Äôt stand it when others do that) but I guess just writing this post is helping to a degree 

Thanks for listening to me, anon internet user. Wish I had the balls to tell someone in real life.

TLDR: Friends at work are saying hurtful things, I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm being oversensitive but regardless it‚Äôs causing me to have violent visualisations of hurting myself/suicide which I can‚Äôt turn off &amp; I feel I can‚Äôt turn to anyone else in real life.",suicide

My gf left me and if i'm honest I don't/didn't think anyone does/will love me. We dated for around a year and a half, and then out of the blue she sent me a text saying it was over. I tried to talk to her but she told me I was gonna end up dead because I haven't asked for help. Shes so mad at me now and for the person you love so much to say the things she said. I feel so crushed. I have been looking into suicide methods for about a year now. I always thought it was comforting that I could just stop the pain ,but now I think more and more about it and i'm thinking its almost time. I guess i'm just looking for a reason to get off the edge. I'm so scared of death but I can't stand another day of trying and trying for nothing. I just don't want to be a problem anymore. To be clear I have talked to my mom who is the only person I can imagine caring about me a little. I told her for 20 minutes how much I hate myself and just want it to stop. She talked about getting me help and then forgot about it. I don't think I can do that again. It was so draining to tell her all of that for nothing. I know i'm just another kid and maybe this is all going to resolve with time but I cannot stress how much I just want a way out.

I graduated in May summa cum laude from a top 30 school. I grew up (and live in) a very wealthy town, and there was always something very ""special"" about me, yadda yadda yadda. 

So I go into college, destroy shit. Everyone talks about how great I am. I'm an amazing writer. I produce the type of work people expect out of students at Ivy League advanced degree programs. I have a lot of friends who care about me, which wasn't really true in high school. I loved college. I wrote an amazing Senior Thesis even though I shattered my collarbone in the middle of writing it and had to type with one hand. Everyone told me I should drop out and graduate a semester late, but I powered through it and got all As that last semester. 

Now I can't get a job. The job ""search"" been the most dehumanizing, degrading process in which I've been involved (including being ""initiated"" by a sports team and having to lick a used dildo) and I've felt sick the past few months. Not sick at myself, because I know I'm doing everything right. Sick at the country and sick at other people. 

I made it to the final round at a prestigious med-tech company for a position paying $65k out of college. They told me during the interview that I seemed like a great fit. I killed it at the interview and thought I was guaranteed a job. Two weeks later: rejected, and they wouldn't tell me why. Because of privacy. Whatever that means.

While that was devastating, I don't give up easily. I got to another final round interview for a consulting job at a Top 50 consulting firm and was asked a ridiculous case study question. The answer to the case was demeaning and unfair, and everyone I've spoken to agrees with me. Unsurprised and unruffled when they rejected me. 

This was all during the summer, and now it's fall. I can't find anything. I send out 50 applications a week, and nobody even responds to me. I do everything right. I try to network, and everyone tries to help. I've spoken with 100 alumni so far, and each phone call is the same. They gush over my resume, and then tell me that their company isn't hiring. Sometimes, when there is a position, they personally hand my resume and cover letter to HR, which is pretty much the best thing possible when applying for jobs. Doesn't matter, I don't hear anything back.

I don't want to see my friends anymore because I'm too embarrassed about not having a job. I can't sleep because I just dream about being offered jobs and actually being happy. My career counselor started crying while she was speaking with me because she felt so bad for me and couldn't understand why I wasn't getting interviews. 

I've felt myself become racist. If I weren't a white male, I would have a job now. I blame affirmative action. I'm becoming a cynical asshole. I used to be interested in learning, but now I don't care anymore. I regret picking my college (even though I loved it), my major (loved it), and my internships (loved them). 

For some reason, I can't get myself to apply to a post-grad internship. Money isn't the problem. I'm a very moral person (not my moral compass being amazing, just that I consider the ethics of every action I make), and I can't let myself apply. The thought of working for free contributing to an economy which hates me is a thought that makes me sick. 

I no longer want to contribute to the US economy because I don't believe in the country anymore. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see what other choice I have. I'm the hero this country deserves, not the one it needs. :)

I don't want to go quietly. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I want to destroy something important. Some action to make everyone realize that this country is not OK, is not safe, and does not offer the opportunity it promises. I've given myself until November 1 to find a job. 

Tell me I'm a fucking dipshit. Don't tell me I'm smart and admirable and worthy, because that's what everyone has told me my entire life.

2901,"Need some help in MS/LA...I'm male, and I live around the Mississippi/Lousiana border near Slidell, and I don't know what to do really...


To start off, I've had minor depression issues on and off for 14 years, but this year it culminated in me actually needing to get meds to help control it, same with anxiety. I've been on the meds for 11 months and I'm in worse shape than in January. Recently, it's become amplified infinitely, due to my wife out of the blue wanting to split up due to a few 'mishaps' in our relationship over the years. I was completely blindsided by this, and she refuses to talk it over, do couples therapy. I'm addicted to her, and we've been together since mid-2005, before I turned 15, and we have 4 kids together, 2 who live with us (2 were adopted out early on in our relationship)


Due to all this, I've been at wits end, considering downing every bottle of pills I can find, and even had the cops and e-squad called on me earlier this week, and I lied to them about me bordering on taking all the pills or not. I don't even want to be in this shape due to my kids. It pains me enough just to sit alone, bawling my eyes out and having to tell my kids to give me a few minutes. 


I saw a counselor on Monday, and she said that I need to work on myself, and throughout my life, I've been told I'm too self-centered, so I have a hard time even doing things for myself anymore, and for psychiatric help, I was told the two closest places earliest I could get in would be three and five months. I've been teetering on self-committment, but I'm worried that something like that could be leveraged against me to keep me from seeing my kids in the future...

The thing is, I convinced my partner to go to the psychiatrist. He got prescribed meds. Everything seemed to be going well, until...
There is this boy that is my best friends for 10 years. There was never chemistry between us, we are just mates. Throughout our friendship he did some nasty things to me, but somehow we always got back.
When I started dating my partner he immediately hated my friend. I told him some bad things that the did to me in the past and it formed an image of an abuser in the head of my partner. The truth is, I should have held my emotions, but even though I tried to explain to him that it's not the case anymore, he hates the friend guy very much. He never openly told threatened me, but after every conversation we have about the friend he gets extremely suicidal. Two days ago he locked himself in the bathroom and later he told me that he held a sharp object and wanted to kill himself, he was very close. I cried like crazy and he told me that he is disappointed that the most important person for him reacts in such way, because it makes him feel like a bad person.
I have no idea what to do. I don't want to lose a long time friend and I feel emotionally manipulated. I have not told anyone because I'm scared that my partner will get mad and will do something bad to himself. When I told him I feel manipulated he wanted to kill himself for being a bad person for me because he felt like psychopath and he hated himself for that. On the other hand, I distanced myself from the friend and he is angry at me for that. He doesn't understand why I did that and he feels cheated because our friendship was very important for both of us. So. Here I am alone. With everyone being angry at me, I feel constant guilt and need to do everything my partner wants me to. I love him very much and I don't want him to end himself. But I also don't want to be put in the position where I need to chose between friend or partner. I feel really sick of this all, I have no idea what to do. My partner doesn't want to go to the therapy with me. He also doesn't want to get any more psychological help. I cannot force him, it must be his decisions. I feel so alone.

Anyone has any tips on how to talk with either of them? I feel embarrased that I got myself to be so manipulated and I don't want to admit it to my friend because he will tell me to leave my partner. And I CANT live him. I would feel guilty if anything bad happens to him. I feel the responsibility for too many people at once. I want to see counselor but first I decided to do a research on the Internet and ask you on this subreddit. How to talk with suicidal people?

And now it's my turn to shout into the void, calling out to anyone who'll listen. Im asking, begging, is there anyone out there who will save me because I can't cope by myself any more. I just can't do it.

I realise there's probably not much point in saying anything since I'm being selfish. You probably shouldn't talk to me because everyone I know seems to think I'm a manipulative bitch. They call me toxic.

I was too much of a coward to do it at 7 years old, so on my 8th birthday I decided I was finally old enough and I went to the ledge to jump. I was frozen for about 30 seconds and stepped off. I knew I was gonna do it eventually but I didn't know when. It was eating away at me for a while, until one day I had enough and just went for it. My fingers slipped and I wiped out and bruised my tailbone. It was exactly what I feared would happen. I got right back up though, and tried it again and nailed it the 2nd time. 

That was almost 15 years ago; I'm 23 now. If someone were to ask me the last time I was proud of myself it would be that day as an 8 year old. I swear to God i'm that much of a loser. 

For the past year I've wanted to just sleep forever. I'm just tired. I honestly feel that urge I had back when I was a kid to just go for it and jump - just end it all. Right now it's not even a matter of will I/Won't I. It's a matter of when.

I'm 100% sure i'm doing it, but I don't want to. Anyone else feel me on this?

This idea that I can still be useful to others is what is keeping me going. That I can guide others to be successful in careers, or boost their spirit, or help them monetarily. When I'm dead, that goes away, right? So, if I have a reason to live, I think it's to give others more reasons to live.

So I kept a tally this year...

112 kids introduced to STEM in the real world, taught programming, given demos, generally attempted to inspire to study technical subjects. (~80% young women)

10 college students mentored in ""social change through app dev"" projects

41 minority college freshman introduced to career options and demo'd

3 college interns directly mentored

1 lady given a job on my recommendation

1 family member helped with suicidal thoughts and taught meditation

I've given up trying to finish my reading list; I read a sentence--sometimes a page--and then close the book. I even bought the VC Pokemon Silver thinking 'well, might as well' but I regret buying it now :(

I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm just bored, I guess. Well, more restless than bored. I'm probably not thinking things through again--maybe the rope I'll buy won't be able to hold my weight, maybe someone will find me before I die, maybe I won't even get that window of opportunity, etc.

In terms of planning I don't have much to think about. I had one constraint at first--I didn't want my grandma to know I had killed myself--but recent events has made me realize I don't care about that anymore; my parents will probably hide it from her anyway.

I feel weird, like I'm just faking this. I've thought about suicide countless of times before but I was always sad or angry. Now I'm just... content? Like I'm not sad enough or angry enough to even think of suicide but here I am anyway.

We had a quick 15 minute ceremony at a lawyers office.  My honeymoon took place at the Sheraton on Midlothian tnpk.  Special....until he said he took all his gf's there.  A year later we moved in with my Grandma to save money and get a house.  At this point we were the proud owners of a ford festiva, $155 a month.  He worked at the local ford dealership.  Needless to say we couldnt move an apartment full of furniture in that micromachine car.  So he bought an f150.  $330/month.  Why did we move to my G'mas?  I went to see my cousins baby with my G'ma. He got mad and went out drinking.  Drove home down the train tracks.   I had two daughters while living in that basement.  He had 2 motorcycles and a boat and a bronco. After 5 years I got the hell out.  To the second apartment.  I got a job cleaning houses.  I bought me an $1100 1980 something mustang.  We moved into a trailer.  I bought me a new 1999 mustang.  We moved 2 more times.  I got a job driving a school bus.  I went to college inbetween.  We moved in with his mother so I could attend nursing school full time.  Big mistake.  Quit and went to respiratory school.  Moved to the east coast of Va.  He bought a bigger boat since we were on the chesapeake bay/rappahannock river.  I tried several times to buy a house, turn down after turn down.  At one point before nursing school I wanted to volunteer at the resque squad.  He wouldnt allow it.  I would be around men...at night.  So I worked in a hospital full of men.  Things that can be done in a confused patients room.  Woooo Guess who got fired and found a job working at nigh?  You guessed it.  Not me.  Effing hypocrit
My daughter turned into a holy terror.  Didnt listen.  Came and went as she wanted.  Had 2 kids I had to take care of at night.  Had to put up with her shit and the trash she brought home.  They didnt listen either.  I begged my husband to quit his job.  I needed him there with me before I killed myself to get away from the shit.  I hated to come home after work so I would stay with my other daughter at her house. We filed bankruptcy after his heart attack because he ""couldnt"" work.   Finally left the state to get away.  This summer 2019, we were close to buying a house.  Until he saw an expedition he wanted.  What was wrong with my equinox at 191 a month?  538 for the expedition.  I let it known that we would not be able to a house again.  Do you think he cared?  He wined like a damn kid until I couldnt take it and said go fucking get it.  Im living with my mother in law.  I have ALS and I'm dying.  Not quick enough.  I married the most selfish SOB Ive ever met.  I have came to the place I literally hate him.  I want to die to get away from him.
Im not perfect.  The night before we got married I was with my exboyfriend.  Who, after 27 years I found him.  I learned a lot that I didnt know was going on in his life.  I wish he would have talked to me about it.  I showed my tits to a few people.  Some got to play and kiss them.  Few years ago hubs dick stopped working due to meds.  Seems to me IF you actually loved your wife you could make lifestyle changes to get off heart meds or use other means to get your wife off.  So I think he doesnt care.  I got' caught sexting with other redditors.  That didnt go well. I was diagnosed with ALS in the morning and he bitched me out calling me everything he could that afternoon.  I guess having been given a death sentence I forgot to delete his texts.
I want a clock that tunes on the hour and to go to the mutter museum and die in my own house.  Do you think that he would do  either for me?  Nope.

molested by mom until 13

she‚Äôs an alcoholic, pathological liar, and straight up certified piece of shit

dad suffered from drug addiction and schizophrenia and wasn‚Äôt around much

he killed him self about 8 months ago

i basically spent my entire childhood alone

my brother and sister were popular and i didn‚Äôt have friends, when their friends were over they were always mean so i‚Äôd just hide in my room

my brother grew up with living with his well-off dad (same mom,different dad) and he doesn‚Äôt understand what our mom put me and my sister through (stealing money from us, fucking our credit, calling cops on us, just being a typical alcoholic shitbag)

even my sister barely understands what i went through, for some reason my mom just decided to pick me to molest and physically abuse

i‚Äôve only told 2 people about what i‚Äôve been through and their the only people in my life

my sister and kayla

i met kayla in a mental hospital last november 

we were both there from friday until tuesday

we became really close in there and talked about everything to each other

we‚Äôd walk the hallways back and forth all day just talking about whatever we were thinking of at the moment

i wrote my number on a piece of paper and gave it to her, i was really nervous but she seemed excited to keep contact when we got out

the first day she got out she broke up with her emotionally abuse ex

he‚Äôd keep messaging her on different social media‚Äôs after she blocked his number/facebook/instagram

over the next 2 weeks we hung out probably 6-7 times even though we‚Äôre both busy with work all the time

she seemed to show some interest in me

she said i smelled good and she said i have pretty eyes all the time

we‚Äôd always have these moments where‚Äôd we just stare into each other‚Äôs eyes not saying anything but it wasn‚Äôt awkward at all

her ex showed up at her house one night and it‚Äôs all gone down south from there

we went from hanging out all the time and texting about our days to barely seeing or talking to each other

in the past month we‚Äôve only hung out twice, she‚Äôs even cancelled a couple times

at first i wasn‚Äôt sure if it was him controlling her or if i was just looking too into things

today we talked on the phone for a bit, she said she‚Äôs been busy with work, school, and seeing someone

she asked me if i wanted to hang out tonight (to smoke)

everytime we‚Äôve hung out, i‚Äôve smoked her up, and the two times we hung out in december it was when she was out of weed

since i was busy with work i asked what she was doing tomorrow, she‚Äôs cooking dinner at her place with a friend

so now i think she‚Äôs seeing someone that not her ex and now that she‚Äôs sees how i‚Äôm such a depressed shy piece of shit that doesn‚Äôt talk about anything but his childhood problems she doesn‚Äôt really enjoy my company anymore and just wants weed out

the only time i‚Äôve ever felt any sort of happiness is with her and now it feels like it‚Äôs all gone and i‚Äôm worse off than before

It all started last year when I was let go from a well paying job, I was unemployed for months draining all my savings while unemployment paid me little to nothing. I applied to so many jobs that I was hopeful for only to get rejection after rejection. I had finally got a job months later but the pay was just enough to get me by month to month. I was struggling but was making it work. Then that job contract recently ended prematurely and I am back on unemployment with little to no savings and not getting enough to pay my bills per month. I am constantly asking my dad to bail me out of going into more debt and getting evicted every month and this month the debt has just piled up and don‚Äôt have enough to pay my rent or even buy food. I have been again getting rejection after rejection on jobs and it‚Äôs made me realize I‚Äôm not as good as I thought I was.

Now I'm almost 30. In April I will be. Since then I have had 2 jobs thinking that was the problem. Nope. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't but I think it's me. Went from one gob to the same one different company, same shit happened. So I switch it up and go to a different job entirely. Kinda. Gas station manager to manager of a beauty store. 
Same shit. Under paid for all the work I do with no help and then I get in trouble for things that are literally NOTHING to do with me. Super long stories that I'm not going to get into. Each time I left because I put my mental health before a shirt retail job. 
Any way now I'm lost and don't know what to do. Earlier I tried to post on financial help sub and got bombarded with so many horrible things that now I'm super right back into holy shit just kill you self mode. 
I've been told every thing I could possibly to do improve my life and career and I have tried everything thing. 
Right now I just want to hear about the good that can happen in life. I just need some hope I guess. If I could drink I would just drink and pass out and wake up and do it all over again like a zombie that I was for years and years in my early 20s. Now I have an ulcer and can't drink, and can't afford any of the drugs that I want to do to get me through this. 
I'm hoping maybe I can just read something to make me smile and give a little hope that maybe, just maybe something good will happen to me that will give me a reason to live. ",suicide

anyway to the point sorry...

is it better for them (2 kids and wife) if they know it was suicide or is it better just to smash my car into a wall at 120km/ph...

im leaning towards the car...as it will make payout by the insurers more likely and they may guess but not know for sure which i think would be more beneficial for the kids to get over. the wife could even say it was an accident and they don't need to know.

the only reason an overdose seem better would be the comfort but then 120 into a wall wouldn't last long...

3037,"14 MonthsI can't believe it's 2013. My depression began at the end of 2011. In an attempt to get better I've been seeing a psychiatrist 2-4 times per month, and for a stretch of six months I met with both a psychologist and a life coach. 

With my doctor's help I've tried various cocktails of Zoloft, Lexapro, Abilify, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Adderall and Ativan. None have helped my depression in a significant way. I've leaned on friends and family for support, improved my diet, and learned mindfulness meditation. (But I must admit I was never able to stick to the meditation for more than a week at a time.)

In short, I spent the last 14 months trying to get rid of my depression, but here I am tonight on SuicideWatch feeling as bad as I've ever felt.

I attempted to take my life last year, but my kidneys and liver were stronger than I gave them credit for. If I try again it will be with the help of the Golden Gate Bridge, which I'm told is 99% effective.

I know that if I continue to fight there's still a chance my depression would go away and I could end up happy again. The odds of this happening lie somewhere between 0 and 100%. But I also know that if I end my life the chances of the pain ending are 100%, and I won't be around to regret it. I suppose that's the tautology of suicide. Nobody who has killed themself has ever regretted it.

I'm practically convinced that ending my life is the better of my two options. The downside of course is the emotional toll it would take on my friends and family. But I counter that with the emotional and financial toll I'm already taking and would continue to take on them in the future.

Although I'm pretty convinced of my decision, I obviously haven't committed to it since I'm here asking for help. Your advice will be appreciated.",suicide

I have no family and no friends whom I do not hurt.  I'm a selfish bitch and I honestly feel that I would be doing a service to the world if I expunge myself from it.  To allow myself, as destructive as I am, to continue to live would be selfish.

Today was my breaking point.  The two people I respect and look up to the most in the entire world I have hurt and disappointed, and they are upset with me and I cannot take it anymore.  They are my research advisors, (they are married), and I loved them as dearly as a daughter would love her parents (I always wanted parents, but I've been alone my whole life, save for a meth-addicted father who sold my body to his friends for drug money when I was 13-14 and is now in prison).  

Recently, I was taken advantage of by an old high school friend and I've been struggling emotionally since that night. Two days ago, I told one of them that I was really anxious and a bit vulnerable, but yesterday he completely snapped at me (for what I perceive as no real reason - it was a miscommunication).  I left the lab in tears, but I returned today because I do have work to do.  However, when I arrived my other advisor took me aside and told me that I'm too emotional and that I have been causing stress to her husband, whom I idolize.

And two days ago, I made on of my friends cry.  What the hell is wrong with me?  I can't take it anymore.  I can't take the fact that I'm so self-absorbed I hurt everyone, EVERY ONE I care about.  I can't stand myself.

A little over 7 months ago, I broke up with my long term highschool girlfriend in search of a more fulfilling life. When we got together, she didn't want me smoking weed anymore, so I stopped. I was a pothead of a sort, so this made me a little sad, but I decided it was worth it. So naturally, when we broke up, I started smoking again. What else should a highschool senior be doing? I smoked every single day for about 7 months, trying all sorts of new drugs along the way. Cigarettes. Alcohol. Opiates. Shrooms. LSD. MDMA. Cocaine. All sorts of fun stuff. I thought that they would give me a new perspective on life, but they only left me as a shell of the person I used to be. I graduated high school about 3 months after I broke up with her, and that's when my drug use really took off. I chose to attend college about 300 miles away from my hometown in an effort to start anew, to be a different person. But now, all I am is alone. I live in a huge city with no money, I'm on the verge of failing some important classes, and have nothing left. All I want is to not be me anymore. I don't want to be anyone. I just want to be nothing. The more and more that I wonder what else I could have been, the more and more it all hurts. All the cries for help, all the lonely nights, all the account overdrawal emails and antidepressants that never worked, they all contributed to who I am as a person today. I've tried to blame people for creating the monster that I am, but the only person there is to blame is me. I'm my own Dr. Frankenstein. After I tried to kill myself, I thought it best to seek out a therapist, and maybe some antidepressant medication. Therapy doesn't do jack shit, and the only thing I have to thank my medication for is my now nonexistent sex drive. Life is so fucking bland, and christ, it's fucking killing me. ",suicide

I don‚Äôt even look alright at all and i can do the bare minimum with myself and i‚Äôm just starting to work with my own hair so yeah i look like shit a lot of the times. This is also very nerve wracking for me because i‚Äôve never had a serious relationship like this.

3104,"I don't even know why I'm posting here.I found this sub yesterday. And I started reading. And I started crying. And haven't stopped. I turned 21 about 6 weeks ago. I never thought I'd live to see this day. I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 18. I never tried it again. I sought help. Got therapy. Was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Became a well-rounded and balanced individual. I can control my schizophrenia so well I only need the drugs on a bad day. 

Spring break was last week. I spent 90% of it curled up in the fetal position on my bed. I didn't move. I didn't sleep. I didn't eat. I didn't speak. I've realized that no matter how happy I seem on the outside, I'm just a hollow, empty shell. There's nothing to me anymore. I don't care about life. I don't care about anything. I remembered what it was like to want to die. 

So I started listing reasons. 

I hate myself. I always have. I find myself annoying, obnoxious and insufferable. How I have friends (and willing friends) I will never understand. I'm too loud. Too boyish. Too dumb. I drive people away because I complain. About everything. I'm awkward. I suck at living. I'm incredibly irresponsible. I can't even keep my school work straight. I can't keep my life organised. I'm so afraid to move out of my parents house and be on my own. I don't even know that I can function as a member of society. I can barely keep my minimum wage job. I can't even keep myself on track to lose weight for my health. It makes me find myself so completely awful and unattractive that I can't even look at myself. I hate that I don't even have any guts. See, there's this guy I've been friends with for a while now. Before this downward spiral I've hit, he made me feel things I'd never felt for anyway. I fell in love with him in a very real way. But I don't have the guts to even tell him that I'm romantically attracted to him, let alone how deep my feelings have gotten. Even if I did, there would be no point. Who could love someone so pathetic? Who could find someone that looks like me even remotely attractive? Either way, I'm fairly certain I've driven him away, too. And then there's all the financial problems with student loans. And my parents relationship. No matter what I do, I'm always the cause of their fights. I'm fairly certain that everyone's lives would improve without me.

I just don't know anymore. What's the point on pushing through this? I've had these feelings for years and nothing has EVER gotten better, even with my therapist, anti-depressants, even attempting this before. Maybe I should have died a long time ago. Maybe I shouldn't have even been born. 

That's not to say I won't be missed. Of course I would. I know I would devastate so many people if I took myself away from them. That's the only thing that's stopping me, and I'm so close to it not even mattering anymore. I would be at peace. Isn't that what would matter? It's incredibly selfish, I know. But...why am I still forcing myself through a life I'm not even living anymore?",suicide

3126,"Flash Archive Porn Review You may have saw my post a little earlier, but here's some background if you haven't. Earlier today I downloaded Flashpoint because Adobe Flash is shutting down later this year and I wanted a chance to revisit all the flash games I played as a kid. Turns out that while it does have what I wanted there's a little more on top; **flash porn**. Most of these are ""games"", games in quotations because really, they're just animations that I can control the speed of. One thing I noticed right away is that the majority of it was furry porn. If you're not into that then Flashpoint might not be the best place to look for fap material. I would have to guess about 65% of the porn is actually yiff. Like I said, not everyone is into that and you might want to avoid that, and that brings me to the next point and that is the lack of previews. The only thing you see is the title and site the animation was hosted on, no tags or thumbnails included. This means that picking something to jerk off to is purely a guess, but it's also more rewarding to find something good because of said guesswork. However, most of what isn't furry shit is low quality, which is understandable considering that most flash content was produced in the 2000's. With all that said, I did end up finding something to nut to, and yes it was yiff, not afraid to admit that.

Overall, I would give using Flashpoint a 6/10 as a source of fap material. It's not practical for your everyday fap, but if you're looking to spice things up and suprise yourself a little it's worth checking out",non-suicide

Recently, I have been obsessing/ruminating on the stuff that I described in that post. It is on my mind 24/7. I feel suicidal all the time because of it, and everyday I think about suicide all the time. I struggle to get out of bed on a lot of days because of how overwhelming the suicidal thoughts are (sometimes when I wake up I stay in bed for 3-4 hours before getting out of bed). Everyday when I try to do my uni work, I am unable to work for long periods of time because of the anxiety/suicidal thoughts which I experience, and because of this I end up having to catch up on my work later at night, so I end up going to bed at \~ 5 am every morning. My sleep schedule is awful because of this.

I find it really hard to interact with others (whether in person or online) because I always get really paranoid that I might unintentionally do something that might upset them.

I am seeing a therapist about it, and I am trying to do the 'homework tasks' he gives me every week, but I am not seeing any improvement. I am also taking medication, I have not noticed any improvement from that either.

I also tried ERP with an OCD group program a few months ago, and throughout the group program the ERP was working and I was somewhat hopeful, but the day after the program finished all of the progress I had made instantly reversed and all of the worries I had came back and I was unable to do the exposures anymore (I don't know why this happened).

I don't really see the point of anything anymore. I'm just a leech who is a burden on others and makes their lives worse. I don't contribute anything positive to society.

I often find it hard to do the homework tasks that my therapist gives me because I am constantly in a low mood and I have zero motivation. And even though I try my best to do the homework tasks, I don't really see the point of doing them, I feel like no matter how hard I try I will never get better. My worries and low mood get in the way of everything I do, and that includes all the effort I put in to try and improve my situation.

A few weeks ago, I was obsessing over the stuff I described in the post I linked, and it got particularly overwhelming on that day and I did not know what to do, and I tried to kill myself. It didn‚Äôt work (obviously) and now I am really upset because I feel like I might have to stay one this Earth and be miserable and anxious for many decades to come. Suicide felt like my last option and since that failed, I don‚Äôt know what to do.

When I am feeling super anxious/depressed/suicidal, nothing can calm me down (including the things I wrote down on the safety plan I made with my therapist). I am tempted to call/message a friend when I feel this way, but after the thing I described in the linked post, I always feel like I am a burden on others when I talk to them about this stuff.

I feel so lonely all the time, but when I talk to either, either in person or online, I constantly get anxious, and when I see how I discussed in the earlier post I linked (again, either in person or online), I have a really bad anxiety attack and I feel suicidal and I can‚Äôt deal with it properly. So I feel super lonely but I am too scared to talk to other people. I am pretty sure that nobody gives a fuck about me, and I don‚Äôt blame them because I truly am a fucking loser.

I just don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. The constant low moods, loneliness and anxiety I experience everyday is unbearable. I can‚Äôt take it anymore.",suicide

3134,"How I skipped online school and got away with it. So where I'm from, some students( including me) still have to do online school because there is still a pretty big number of COVID-19 cases in my area. The thing is, at my highschool we are still forced to do EVERY class we did when we were going to school, including P.E( even tho some of us barely have the room to do it).

 I'm really bad at P.E, and today we had to do push ups, and I can't do push ups to save my life, so I decided that I wouldn't go to P.E class today. Now, if I simply didn't join the online meeting I would get in trouble, so I needed to come up with an excuse. I couldn't just come out with a simple one like ""I was sick"" or ""I needed to go to the dentist"" because this was not the first time I didn't join a P.E meeting and the professor would figure out I'm BS-ing. So I needed to come up with a plan. 

I wear braces, and I go to the dentist at least once a month for a monthly check, and everytime I go, they give me a little ticket with the date of the next appointment. For exemple, in January they gave me a ticket saying ""23 february 14:15""(I live in Europe). And guess what I thought of. If only I could write over that 23 a 17 without  my P.E teacher realising that I wrote over it, go to the dentist, give a photo of me at the dentist and a photo with the little falsified locket to the teacher so that I have ""proof"" that I really went to the dentist, I could get away with it. 

So that's exactly what I did. I wrote 17 over 23, it wasnt perfect but it didn't needed to be, I changed, washed my teeth( so that I would really feel in character) and went to the dentist. Now I didn't go in the dentist's cabinet, that would have been too much, but I went outside of it and photographed it. I also photographed the ticket, but I left a little bit of it outside the photo, mostly the part where it said ""17"" because I figured if the teacher saw that I went to the dentist, and saw the ticket, he wouldn't ask why a little part of the ticket was missing. I already went too far, if he wasnt already satisfied with this, then I don't know what I could have gone. 

And then I went back home. Ironically, on my way back home, I ran into another classmate who also missed P.E because she went to the dentist, but she was telling the truth. I showed her my little trick and she couldn't believe that I went that far just to miss P.E. The teacher didn't respond to my message and the 2 photos, but he also didn't respond to the message of my other classmate saying she went to the dentist, so that means that he believes me, or at least that now both of us are in the same boat.

In conclusion, I don't really recommend doing what I did, but I'm very socially anxious and I don't like people watching me doing things that I'm horrible at( like pushups) at all. I feel like everyone is looking at me even though I'm sure most of them are also having a lot of trouble with it, too. But Chaotic Good does what Chaotic Good does, and here I am.

I have PTSD from 13 years of sexual abuse from my dad. I have anxiety and OCD. I had two panic attacks this evening and no friend would pick up the phone. I texted a new friend who is my coworker and now I regret it and think work will be awkward tomorrow. I have a new job I like but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm not learning fast enough. My coworker says I‚Äôm doing fine but I don‚Äôt believe him. I feel stupid for texting him in the first place even though he said he has anxiety and if I ever want to talk I can text him. I shouldn‚Äôt have. I can‚Äôt keep friends. My best friend she just used me as an ATM and for favors. I stopped it today and ended the friendship. I just feel lost. Depressed. Hungry but too tired to eat. I look at my puppy and cry because I don‚Äôt want to leave her if I hurt myself. I scratch my hands instead every time i panic and now I have scars. My hands are ugly. I have a significant other. He‚Äôs at work so I feel like I have nobody right now to turn to. My family forgot my birthday last week; they went to a casino the night of my scheduled dinner and didn‚Äôt invite me. A week later my significant others family scheduled a dinner for my birthday and I showed up to a table of 8 and nobody was there, they forgot. I just feel stupid and alone. Every time I have a panic attack I want To dial the suicide hotline but I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know anymore. I took my anxiety medicine just now. About to eat. Hoping the thoughts go away.

Fast forward a couple months back,I felt into the pit,feeling lower then ever so my coping mechanism was to drink.Slowly but surely I stopped carrying about anything,quitting my job,and because I had so much free time now I began to drink even more,and it ended sooooo bad.....my last gf couldn't reach me by phone,which was unusual, so she had to leave early from work cuz she had a feeling so she came to my apartment and founded me passed on the floor,she called the ambulance,but I was already in a coma.I woke up in the hospital some days later.After a week from being externated from the hospital my dear,dear gf broke up with me,who could blame her after I did to her,I'm just a piece of shit.And now I'm here,no friends,no family,no gf,almost broke.What should a person like me do?maybe pieces of shit like me shouldn't be alive.

Eventually this leads to me being evaluated at a hospital which I lie to them about basically every question they ask me, I constantly denied that it was me who said they where suicidal even though they had some sort of solid proof.

I wasn't it the shape that I wanted to be in, and found myself becoming not focused and lazy. I have spent time on that, and recently developing better workout routines, and study habits. Skip to yesterday, I am over with a friends house and I have been texting with this girl I have had a crush on for a while. I decide that it is the time, and my boy (who also has a gf) has been hyping me up. For the longest time I wanted to ask her out but assumed she would reject me. I thought this could be a perfect time for me to just shoot my shot, and try to improve from this situation. Anyway, I asked her and she freaked out and got really embarrased. She said she would love to, and we have been texting a ton since. She said that she had a crush on me too, and I was so glad it worked out. I have been in relationships before, but niether really count as they were just 2 flings. I'm familiar with the relationship drama in our class and know that she broke up with another guy a few months ago. That wasn't really a relationship either, as the person who asked her never did much, and didn't treat her with much respect. I really know how great a person she is and I have been so happy recently! I really want to have fun with her, and know that I will not just leave this as a fling. I have been thinking a lot about what things we should do together, and since there is a pandemic right now I know it will be difficult. Anyone who has been a relationship with someone (especially in COVID), it would be very much appreciated if you let me know some fun activities you have engaged in with your signifacant other!

Im missing half the school days becaude i dont want to get up, and when i am at school all i can think about it how much better it would be if I was asleep or dead, or how much the people around wouldnt care if I wasnt there anymore. I tried last on dec 17 and it didnt work my parents never found out, i took the day after off and on the 19th  i went to school. 

Doing anything productive makes me feel like dying. Its like my head is constantly just telling me to put myself out of my misery. I dont want to be here anymore, and at this point i dont know if I mean the town, the school, the state or even the world. I want to be somewhere else, but I dont want to die. Its starting to feel like the last place i can turn to. Its so exhausting hiding it and doing the things that are constantly making me feel like i should be dead. 

I dont know how to get help. I'm not close with my parents. They dont understand how serious my issues are, when I was first diagnosed with anxiety i was sent to one therapy session, and then when the next one was scheduled, they never took me. Last march i mentioned my anxiety again and my dads response to help was ""just talk to people"" so i dont see them as an option. When I was around 8 or 9 my older sister tried to kill herself, and thats when they took her to therapy, not after she asked and asked. 

Last week my school faced the reality of an old classmate comitting suicide, there wasnt much talk about it, a few Snapchat stories, no assembly or offers to help any students who may have been greiving, or even any help to prevent other students from trying. I didnt know this kid, but it was an eye opener seeing the path i was setting up for myself. The scary thing is that it didnt push me farther, it made me want to hurry up the process and get it over with, like the lack of offers to change was just a clear path to escape. Like even if I got caught, i wouldnt be talked to about it. 

I'm so scared of confrontation, i hate serious situations, i dont know how to get out. I dont want to be here anymore and i don't know what to do except jump the gun and swallow the pills. 

Sometimes im okay. Sometimes, like now, its really hard to resist. Other times ive got 3 pill bottles in front of me and the only thing stopping me is procrastination. Im okay for tonight, im going to sleep, the only thing ive taken is melotonin so I can sleep, but its just getting harder and harder to keep myself alive. Please help me find some way out of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was about 12 I had thoughts about suicide, I was severely depressed and it became the norm for me to think about it daily - although I never planned on acting on it, then. Through the years my periods of depression came and went, sometimes for a month and once or twice for a full year (2012, 2016). Do to the fact I would think about this so often, it had normalised it in my head - or only now do I realised I normalised it. The past few months have been particularly bad for me. I've lost my job that I loved, have had to move out from my flat back to my parents and been diagnosed with ADHD. And I'm finding it really fucking difficult to find a job, or at least one that is as creatively fulfilling (I'm a designer). I've been processing a lot of things recently - and have been thinking about it a lot - not with any intention. It's now affecting me in my day-to-day - I find it really hard to find motivation because at the back of my head I feel like thats where it could end up, its inevitable, its been staring at me running through my mind for all these years and I just never acknowledged it so.   


Ontop of that, something changed last night. I had been thinking about it alot before I go sleep, I cant seem to help it it just happens. I have always processed it alot, but not with any intention. Last night when I was lying in bed, it was like a wave or something and I dont know what happened but all of a sudden I became completely comfortable with it. Like, 100%.   


I don't plan on acting on it, but I'm finding it really hard to shift this 'inevitability' from front of mind. And **that** scares me.   


Does any one else get this, lifetime bombardment of thoughts and fear of in the inevitable? Is this fucking normal?

I've had the urge to kill myself for a couple years now. It's just that recently the idea pops up in my head more often. 

I feel like my whole life I've been abandoned, my parents, friends, and others have left me in the dust for something better. I've had girls tell me they love me, think I'm perfect, and want to be with me. But they'll date someone else while leading me on. It's come to the point that I'm desensitized to things like that. I don't think I can love someone without worrying it's going to end abruptly. 

It's just that sometimes I'll think 'hmm, oblivion, no emotions, no pain, peace.' And I'll contemplate just killing myself. I mean, once I'm dead I won't have to worry about anything. I'll be free. Nothing to cause me pain. 

So, yeah, I guess you could call me suicidal. I see no happy future for me, and all my happy memories have something bad attached.

From here on is my previous post, after this comes the edit.

""We have met in a game only about a week ago and I already know a lot about you. You are depressed and suicidal, the things you went through must be unbearable. We have been talking on snapchat and you were telling me things that really made me sad. I sometimes bug you and call you to make sure you are alright and spam you but that's only because I care. Yesterday at night I wrote to you for the last time as I didn't get any response anymore after calling and messaging several times. Today I really got anxious and took action. I live in another country but I still took measures and called the institutions you said you were going to. I even called your school and the police. Sadly they wouldn't tell me if you were alright or not because of security reasons. I kept calling your school and they told me if I called one more time I would get reported. I called the police and they told me they'd send a unit to your school to make sure you were ok. About an hour/1,5  ago I saw your snapchat location showed you were online at that moment. I still try to reach for you. And I am very sorry if I vexed you and caused you trouble. The police told me they would contact your parents, and I know your father is an asshole and tells you to kill yourself, so I hope he didn't flip out or anything. I wanted to come visit you in London but you refused and didn't feeI comfortable with it which is understandable, I asked for your phone number you didn't give it for the same reason.

3207,"I simply cannot restartHello complete fucking strangers. I usually am on the other end of these things begging strangers to change theit habits meditate, read some books, stop thinking negatively, pick up an instrument, exercise, ect ect... Today is different though, I have found a problem for which there is no contingency. 

I have been depressed for years, since I was 10 years old. I was a isolated angry child. In high school I was an akward pariah with a bad reputation. Through out most of my childhood I have been bullied or been involved in horrible one sided relationships. Toward the end of junior year things started to turn around for me. I was making real friendships, and I had a social life.

About a year ago my most recent bought of anxiety and depression started. My main group of friends blew up when an argument between me and a friend horribly escalated. Nobody really talks anymore and it made me look pretty terrible to say the least. Soon after that I noticed one of my oldest friends was sociopathic. He lied to me on multiple occasions, wether it be telling me the girl I was talking to was a lesbian or when he snitched another friend out ruining his life to keep himself out of trouble. When I confided in him he would use it as ammunition in later arguments. ""This is why everyone hates you"", he knew how paranoid I was about that type of shit. One day he was on Xanax driving stuffing his face with McDonald's. I pleaded with him to pay attention but they were met with insults. He almost wreaked, and after that I kicked him out of my life. He than told everyone I was unstable, and since I stayed bitter while he cleaned up his act. He stopped pissing everyone off and dug in his heels while I tried to convince a few other something was wrong. ""That's just how he is, he's just a dick sometimes"", needless to say I lost to his manipulation. I can see on Instagram and snapchat how much fun they have without me. I don't really have my friends from high school between these two incidents my reputation has been severely damaged. Now at work I am getting a reputation for being a weirdo. It's getting harder and harder to communicate with others, and I can hear the part-timers in particular openly talking shit. 

My brother and I were discussing how bad things have gotten. He tells me my only option is to restart find completely new friends and a new job. It's that or be ignored by everyone who I thought was my friend and be stuck in a workplace that's beginning to feel a lot like high school.

3251,"Lost my job, the closest thing I've had to a girlfriend and my last shred of confidence...For the last few months I've been out of work on disability for depression which I've struggled with for the past 15 years (I spent a year and a half of high school in an outpatient program at a hospital, residential treatment centers, laundry lists of psychotropics...).  Last Thursday I had another meeting with my psychiatrist to finish the paperwork to extend my disability (already a month late) with a little assignment she had given me.  Because she had taken a month to complete the paperwork, my office sent a letter stating that if the disability claim wasn't worked out or if I didn't return to work by last Friday, I would be terminated.  So, when I show this letter to my doc, she tells me I should just go back to work and that she wouldn't sign anything else affirming my inability to function on the job.  

I went straight from the doc to a female friend's house who had just moved to the city a week before.  I had fallen in love with her in high school but then she started dating my best friend.  I held my tongue as long as I could but finally just had to tell her how I felt, making all of my friends think I was trying stab her boyfriend in the back.  So I was shunned by the bunch of them for a good year or so until the bf left the country.  However, throughout all of this I kept in touch with  the girl with whom I exchanged emails fairly regularly.  This was about seven years ago.  

We go get a bite to eat and when we get back to her place she's all over me, the most affection I've ever been fortunate to receive.  We keep out pants on, but that's about it.  I go home feeling on top of the world.  She has some obligations the next day, so I spend the time deep cleaning my apt, finally doing something productive.  The following day, we spend the whole day together, capped off with even heavier petting and repetitive proclamations of love from both of us (her first...).  

The next day, last Sunday, we were to see a concept together that we'd both been excited about for weeks and which she couldn't stop talking about.  About an hr before I went to pick her up, she sends a text saying she got strep throat and couldn't speak... I was a little suspicious, given the hours we spent in each others mouths the night before, but whatever, just wanted to do what I could to help her feel better.  No response, no response, no response.... must just be sleeping it off.

Finally, Monday night at around 11pm, after I'd flown to my parents' for the holidays, I get a text saying ""I want to be blunt, I have no romantic feelings for you.""  It was like I got the wind knocked out of me before I'd even taken my first breath...  She defriended me on face book, and hasn't responded to anything since.  What hurts/scares me the most is that this just makes me doubt even more my ability to understand people which has always been excruciatingly difficult.  

I don't have a job, I don't have any friends I can talk to in my city, have an incredible difficulty speaking to those elsewhere, and those that I'm closest to are in the process of kicking heroin...   Every girl/woman I've ever been interested in has either completely blown me off or led me on for months/years (multiple ""I love yous,"" always conditional.  Either just over a breakup and ""need some time"" or ""just not in *that* way).  And every time just hurts more...

It's been 15 years of people saying it will get better, and it will momentarily, but every time I fall, I fall farther and harder.  And after going through the psychology/psychiatry circuit for so long I've haven't heard anything new in a long fucking time...  Not to mention that the therapist I bonded most with and helped shape my view of the world, who I saw for 10 years, had a breakdown himself and no one (knew his friends/family by the end) has heard from in a few years.  He was last seen being released from the psych ward.  And the psychiatrist I bonded most with (4 years) had a breakdown too and stopped practicing.  

I've become more and more closed off from new therapists, always downplaying suicidal thoughts because I don't want to committed, and if I really do want to die I don't want them stopping me.  Even when I do open up I just get the same things I've heard for fucking years...  

The thought of hurting my family which has been so supportive my whole life is the only thing that has prevented me, but even that is meaning less to me as the days go by...

I don't really know why I'm posting here... 

tl;dr: 15 years of depression, forever alone, lost job, teased with a relationship, shunned, no local friends, out-of-town friends have their own issues namely heroin....

Still, I'd rather face the sweet embrace and chill of the afterlife than live with the obsessive, and quite frankly, creepy behaviour that I can't seem to be rid of.

I've driven all my friends away, save the select few I've known for years. I've distanced myself from family, and I live with the consistent guilt from an event that happened years ago that I can't let go of until I'm forgiven by whom I'd hurt. 

Suicide, and for that matter, any death, is not 'the easy way out', because it's enduring one final pain to make the rest stop. Those of us who have been driven over that border do not fear the great darkness, we embrace it. While it brings sorrow to our families, they get over it, just like the rest of the problems they face.

We're remembered for the positives, not for the negatives. And, I think that counts for something. It's not cowardice that drives is to that point. It's one final breath of courage.

I have 15 bucks in my PayPal account and no idea what I'm going to do if I don't get a job in the next couple of days. Tonight is the first time I've cried about my problems because I really don't know if I want to wake up tomorrow (if I can even sleep at all).

3332,"My reason to live left me. I don't want to go on, I don't know if I can.My life has been miserable for as long as I can remember. A broken home, poor family, drunken stepfather, loving but weak willed mother, and 2 siblings that I love but was too angry to be a good big brother for.


All the way up until I left for college, I was filled with sadness, rage and hate, hate for myself. I cut myself a lot in high school, because I hate who I am and hurting myself felt right. The scars are still very visible even today. 


All of those feelings finally faded after I met her. She wasn't the first person I loved, but she was the first one who TRULY loved me back, and was really good to me. Just a few weeks after we started dating we cried in each other's arms because we were so happy together, so happy to find someone good in this world.


She is my world, she's the only thing in my life that made me want to live, and for the past 4 years I have lived, just so I could be with the one person who helped me to finally be happy. She's everything to me, and I know in my heart there's no one else out there who could be as wonderful as her.


Today, Nov 5, would have been our 4 year anniversary. Wednesday of last week, on the 1st, she left me while I was at work. I never saw it coming, but I came home to find the door unlocked, all of her things gone, and a note saying goodbye. She never talked to me about any problems in our relationship, if she had I would have done anything to make it right, anything to make her as happy as possible, but I didn't know. We never fought, never argued, just love, so much damned love that I thought I was in a dream.


Her note said she resented me for my procrastination, and that I didn't share enough of her interests. The things she noted I would have gladly went out to do with her, if she'd only talked with me things could have been even better for us both. I loved going on dates with her, money has just been tight the past few months after we moved, and she didn't give us a chance to get back on our feet to do nice things again.


I gathered from her note that she has gone back to her ex, the one person that has a truck, the one person who I've not gotten a response from. I trusted her to talk to him online because it was a group chat with all of their friends in it. I trusted her to go on a week vacation with all of those friends, including him, because I thought she truly loved me all these years and would never betray that trust. 


When she came back, she acted a little different. At first I thought she was adjusting to coming back home. I finally asked her what was wrong but she said everything was fine. Not wanting to push I thought I'd let her talk to me when she was ready. Now she's gone and I've heard nothing from her since.


I haven't eaten since she left, I can't sleep well if even at all, I had panic attacks in my sleep a couple of nights ago. I'm back in the darkness that I thought I'd escaped years ago. I hate myself for losing the one person who was good to me. I hate myself for not being what she wanted. I want to die so I don't have to feel this pain anymore, so I don't have to be without her. She took her guns so I would have to do it painfully with a knife. It would hurt, but I don't even care about that, I deserve the pain because of this self hatred that I can't suppress.


There's only one thing that holds me back. My little brother died at age 17 this year in May. Losing him hurt us all, most of all my mother. I love her, she's a loving mother and I don't want to put her through losing both sons in the same year. However, at the same time I feel like after all these years of pain I deserve to be selfish just one final time. I feel like everyone should understand that I deserve to end my pain and misery. I've been so good to my lovers and they always hurt me deeply, this one being the worst pain I've ever felt, because I truly felt in my heart that she was the one.


Would my mother, my family understand this? Could they forgive me for wanting to be free of the pain? I don't want them to feel guilty, like there was anything they could do. It's just me, there's something wrong inside of me, and I can't cope with it anymore. My love was the one person who took the pain away, without her I can't take it. It's all come back in a rush of agony and hurt. I'm only 24, and imagining dealing with this misery until I die of natural causes is too much, I can't bear the thought of it. I just hope that telling people who might understand these things, that I can't tell my family, might help.

I'm bipolar, so I know this is all bound to end, rather soon, soon being probably in 6 months at least. So it's not that I believe this is a never ending pain thing. But the depression really hurts and I'm scared I'm going to commit suicide. I don't want to actually die, I want to live and enjoy life. I don't want the ones I love to grieve, although I wish they would understand where I'm coming from, understood how bad things are. I go to work and just cry and it's so embarrassing. 

I feel like I can't trust myself. I'm afraid if I get in my car and drive I'm going to drive to where I where I want to commit it. I'm scared I'm going to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night when everyone is sleeping and commit it. I feel like I'm on the brink of doing that. I feel like this is the end and I can't imagine actually living another week or so. I feel like I want to do this and this is my destiny. I'm scared this is going to be one big impulse and I won't be able to take it back.

So I've been telling myself suicide is an active, conscious decision. It won't happen unless I decide to do it. So here are my questions, what if I /decide/ to do it, and go off to do it, how do I stop myself, what am I suppose to do? When people commit suicide, do they have a clear reason in their mind?

I see a therapist and psychiatrist. My pdoc just gave me a new anti depressant so I'm really hoping it works sooner rather than later. I do all they say to treat depression but it's not work. So yes I do exercise and all these different things a therapist would suggest. ",suicide

I have 10 siblings (one living with us, locks himself in his room) that don‚Äôt talk to me though i wish they did, give me advice for what to do or explain how they dealt with my parents. my mom is an alcoholic, at least once a week she‚Äôll get nasty, call me names, says she‚Äôll kill herself because she cant deal with us, hit me, etc. my dad will skip days off work because he cant get out of bed, incredibly down. hes an alcoholic as well, less functional when hes drunk but wouldnt hurt anybody. hes extremely sensitive and if someone looked at him a certain way or didnt reply to him or laugh at his jokes he‚Äôll yell, say we dont love him or leave

an online friend ive had is honestly the only thing keeping me alive, i look forward to talking to them even though its incredibly awkward and starting to go downhill. its all i ever think about, and when theyre feeling down themselves i completely shut down. everything is so much more intense when theyre away or something is wrong over there. i know its not healthy to absolutely depend on someone else. im having a lot of trouble finding new friends and sharing the love to multiple people. im terribly shy and insecure, if i think i did something wrong ill go on an apologizing rampage and bash myself in chat and ruin the atmosphere. and then ill say sorry for that too. ill go away for weeks because i think i deserve it and that they would want me to. come back and apologize because id worried them, feel awful. similar to what my dad does.l

theyve been having a lot of trouble on their half as well, itd be another paragraph to explain it though. weve been exchanging vents but its only tearing us two apart, and we know it. weve gone over it, started over, a million times. if they go i will too

i know i have to look ahead to ever get through it, but right now i dont know if I even see a future at all. and i know there are countless people going through unimaginable situations, feels so selfish to even vent. i believe that if youre your top priority, youll take care of yourself no matter what environment youre in. but if youre not, youre just gonna bully yourself no matter where you go. idk how to move forward, ive tried so many times, i can predict how people try to help, twist it around and make it negative

it feels so pointless, i ask them if they want to talk, they say ‚Äúi do‚Äù when were both aware that it will fall again, we‚Äôll hurt ourselves again, shit will happen over and over.  but i cant leave it, nor can i leave this house. even if i got away its still in my head, im stuck forever unless i go. everyday i go to school itching to go home to hurt myself, unless my friend is happy then i am. so mad at myself feel like ican do anything",suicide

3381,"I don‚Äôt have an interesting titleThis is really long btw. So if nobody reads it I understand

I don‚Äôt even know how to start this off. I‚Äôm just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. I‚Äôm also self destructive. 

I moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought it‚Äôd make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. 

So my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. 

The job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. 

Eventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. 

It just wasn‚Äôt enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. 

I left when I decided I should go to school. I‚Äôm in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. 

My first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I don‚Äôt even know if I want to do it anymore.

I‚Äôm just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then I‚Äôm back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I don‚Äôt think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. 

At my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. It‚Äôs a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. 

I‚Äôm visiting my friends in another state right now. 
Reconnected with an old friend. (Not the one I‚Äôm staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasn‚Äôt good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think I‚Äôve really fucked it up now. She didn‚Äôt even want to talk to me the next day after.

We are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that won‚Äôt go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. 

I just can‚Äôt get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month.

A coworker of mine has struggled with depression for a long time (I believe at least a decade), but I have known him for only the last year and a half. He recently entered a relationship with a former coworker, and I'm not sure if she knows but I have never met her so it is not my place to let her know his current situation. The only reason I know he is suicidal is that he posted in here two months ago and I recognized his username. 

Because I'm not his girlfriend and we do not interact on a daily basis, I don't know how to show my support without seeming awkward or intrusive. He plays a major role in the restaurant we both work in, but this has clearly had a major impact on his mental health. 

Everyone's mental health is different. What works for one person (i.e., medication, therapy, support) may not work for another. However, I want to know how to connect with this person and let them know that there are resources available to him, be it our human resource department or some other counselling service.

I'll only tell you some basic facts about me, only because you don't need my life story. I'm drunk right now so I'm sorry if I make any typing or grammar mistakes:

First off, as I just mentioned, I'm drunk. This is an issue because I'm underage, in fact I'm not even an adult. It isn't that I'm going out to parties to get drunk, in fact it's the opposite. The people who are supposed to love me the most and protect me are my enablers, my parents, who have drank before and after my birth for as long as I have been able to remember. I'm the last child, the youngest, so I am a victim and a product of dealing with my parents who are at the age of where they don't give a fuck anymore. My dad is a reserved, quiet, nice man. He brings home the bread and that keeps him happy, aside from his booze. My mother is the polar opposite, jobless, a ""stay-at-home"" mom, suffering from a disease that makes her head feel like she's been spun around in a tornado and then let go. She's loud, gets angry easily, and makes my life more miserable than I'd like. She's also one of the most emotional and passionate people I've ever met and I love her. She's lost a son before and that's been one of the reasons I haven't offed myself yet.

Tonight, we had our weekend tradition. Get drunk, play games, listen to music, chill, and talk. During the play games session (I get very upset over games, I got my short temper from my mother) I got angry at my mother for how she was playing the game, she started to yell at me, I threw my cards at her, almost broke my bottle from slamming it, and retreated to my computer. No one has spoken to me since. 

Since they are asleep, I began going through the medicine cabinet and I began looking at medicine in there. Googling the overdose effects and seeing how long it would take to kill me. Nothing I found interested me, most of them would kill me in 70+ hours after tons of pain and suffering, which isn't what I want. Hanging myself seems too awful, every time I think of it I picture the screams of whoever finds me, and I don't want to do that to someone. There's no working guns in my house, so that's out of the option. 

I don't know anymore, I just actively looked for ways to kill myself. If I found something proper, I probably would've done it. What the fuck is wrong with me?",suicide
3411,"Im uncertain of what i want. death by dehydrationI've thought about killing myself a few months back when I was pretty fucked up emotionally, I didn't know how i would want to do it and what way would be painless and wouldn't cause as many problems for my family. But now I think im ready and I think I've found my way out. 

Context to this situation is Im a 20 y/o gay male and the only friend I have is my ex boyfriend, he's now found his way into another relationship, im happy for him, but in this sense ive lost my friend because he doesn't want to hurt his partner by just participating in idle chat with me. With everything else happening in my life, losing the one person I talk to sent me to have a mental break and I sat crying in front of my ex after he had told me that he can't talk to me any more, I cried and couldn't even make sense of what i was saying, what pained me the most is that he looked at me as if I was insane. There was just alot of me crying because I had lost my friend (at this point he wasn't someone I though of as my ex partner, he was just my best friend) he drove me home and couldn't help but just sit in silence. As I hopped out of the car I said the main things that i enjoyed about when I saw him but I ended the conversation with ""thank you, I love you like family, and I'm sorry"" with little tears in my eyes I let out a gentle smile (this would probably be the last time I see him). I few days have passed since then and I've taken it upon myself to voluntarily refuse water and food in hopes of having a death im comfortable with.

I got fired a month ago because I blew up on management for the constant shitty treatment they gave me every day and so they kicked me out and banned me from the property and since then I havent found a full time job no matter how hard I try.

I have severe social anxiety so anything I try to do that involves going somewhere or doing something new I get so nervous and freak out I usually just go back home and sit in my room. The last time I truly remember being happy was when I was a kid. Its only gone downhill since I graduated high school 8 years ago. The only thing that even makes me slightly smile anymore is my dog, but with her health (over weight blind diabetic and being a pug has respiratory issues) she wont be around forever since she has all that and is already 10.

3416,"My ""life"" ended a long time agoI'm posting here because I'm for the most part done with living. Life has nothing to offer me. Never has. 

First, I'm going to describe myself so those who will be turned off by talking with someone like me will know up front.

I'm 5'3"", about 150, 55 years old, medium-brown skinned female, short small nose, a jutted jaw with thin lips, sunken eyes, a metal hip and cataracts. Face looks flat from the side and people have called me ""retard"" or ""Down syndrome"" because of it. I might actually have something wrong with me genetically. I've always had poor muscle tone. So there, I'm ugly, and on top of that, I'm probably a narcissist with schizoid affective disorder, have been hospitalized in medical and mental institutions more than 15 times. I was assaulted in one of the mental institutions. 

I have never stopped thinking of committing suicide. I think about it every single day, have done so since my early teens. I was almost successful back in 2011. Worst day ever for the entire world. I should have died then, at least.

Not one person on this earth is compatible with me. Several people have said to me, ""Don't nobody want you,"" and they have been right. Even the guy I was married to and divorced didn't like me for anything but as much money he could spend. I can't think of one family member with whom I've been close. I'm a burden to them all, and that number has always been around five or less.

So, for all of my life, I've been pushed off on people whose job it was to ""provide services"" to me. Now, even those people don't want the job.

3421,"A Substitute Teacher's View on False Accusations First off, I'm 27, so I'm definitely outside the intended audience here, but a thread from this sub came up on /r/all of someone very upset that their favorite teacher and mentor was getting fired unfairly. I wanted to chime in with some thoughts from my perspective as someone who's had the pleasure of substitute teaching over the course of a couple years in a bunch of different schools in California. 

I've certainly encountered students behaving extremely inappropriately, and I've even had a troubled student or two joke about reporting me for things they made up. It is, on a personal level, really icky and kinda scary, but you put on your blank face, remind them to focus on that math problem, and move on. Educators have a lot on their side. Often too much so. Staff is pretty fundamentally almost always going to side with teachers over students. It is not easy at all to get a teacher fired, or even to get a school to stop bringing in a particularly bad substitute. Furthermore, educators have it drilled into them how to behave appropriately with students, which includes keeping things public and keeping contact with students outside of school limited and professional. This is for the safety and wellbeing of everyone, and as long as a teacher is following standard practices and not straying off the path, it's very unlikely for any sort of false accusations to get them fired. 

If a teacher is getting fired, there's probably really strong evidence of utterly unacceptable behavior, and it's also likely a pattern of behavior. Anything less, and the default attitude of many people is that the person saying something is lying.  


In any case where the facts are in doubt, well, schools have a lot of reasons to prefer sweeping things under the rug. A fired teacher is a big deal, it makes waves. A broken hearted or troubled student being lectured to stop lying, just being ignored or patronized, or being sent off to a different school is all sadly normal. If a school is actually taking action on students' reports of harassment, there's probably a lot more to it than you might think, or than what you really have a right to know about.   


I get feeling defensive of favorite teachers. I can tell you that teachers appreciate it. But that feeling is from your experience with that teacher, and other students have their own experiences. Just as you show different sides of yourself with different people, that teacher may behave very differently with someone else. If they did do something horribly wrong to someone else, well if history class teaches anything it's meant to be that people are complicated and that even national heroes can also do monstrous things. Part of growing up is coming to terms with those things and not letting them make you suspect the worst of people.  


Speaking of which, do cabals of students conspire to fabricate evidence and successfully get teachers fired for funsies? I expect it's happened. Cabals of students have literally murdered people. But it is not **normal**. It is in fact very **rare**. If a teacher is fired at your school (for non-budget reasons), however great they were to you, they very likely stepped way out of line with someone else. And if they did that with one kid, they probably did it with others who didn't say anything.   


As serious as false accusations are, and they should never be made, real abuse is far more serious in the harm that it does. Please don't rush to judgement, especially not of your peers. It's okay to not have a strong opinion on something you've heard about second hand.   


If you have experienced someone behaving inappropriately towards you, please tell an adult that you trust, and/or take a leap of faith on someone who works for your school. All education staff are mandated reporters and you **will** find someone who will be on your side if you open up.

I've worked out fashion choices, gotten good at makeup and have a good haircut and a so-so voice. But I can't pass to anyone. I'm just treated or assumed to be a femme gay guy no matter what I do. I regularly get stares, comments (made loud enough for me to hear), laughter, glares, sometimes slurs, sometimes people following me, passive-aggressively shitty service in most businesses I go to and taken advantage of guys who know that I'll sleep with them if they lie to me and tell me I'm pretty. Facial feminization surgery is $20k at least and with my shitty field choice I won't be making that any time soon. Plus, I suspect the surgery won't have that much effect on me as I've seen results and the changes are usually subtle i.e. pushing someone from andro to femme not from masculine to femme, so i'm fucked regardless. Also I'm sterile from the hormones.

The job I currently have is pretty taxing on my wrists, and my hearing is already suffering for no apparent reason. Why should I feel obligated to hang around? I'm not in a crisis, but killing myself a little after I turn 30 is looking extremely appealing. I know it sounds selfish, but I'd have literally nothing to live for at that point, so why continue to exist only to have my physical health take a turn for the worse until I die, working a job I'd likely hate, still wishing I had friends or anyone to share my life with to a reasonable extent.

3434,Life‚Äôs not worth it anymoreHi so today I decided that within the next week I will kill myself. I came to this choice after my best friend slept with the girl I love last night. This is not the only reason but it‚Äôs the one that finally broke me. I‚Äôm an unattractive guy. And my biggest fear is never finding someone to actually have a connection with. I had a connection once with a girl in highschool with me but she was very abusive. She like to cut me with knives because it gave her pleasure. I was in a relationship with her for four years until I went to college and that was 3 years ago. I have problems with girls because of this relationship and I never can find an outlet to voice my pain because I‚Äôm a guy and guys just can‚Äôt do that shit. At least that‚Äôs how I was raised. So you see with this last straw and everything else I just don‚Äôt feel like any of this is at all worth it anymore. Why live when for 3 years all I felt was pain/mistrust to people. So that‚Äôs why I decided to do this. I‚Äôm only typing this because I don‚Äôt want to leave behind a letter. That would ruin my parents ,suicide

3441,"Just want you're opinion on how I'm feeling right now.For a while now I thought the nightmares and dreams I've been having were becoming more and more vivid but it was only recently that I've come to realize that it wasn't that they were becoming more vivid but rather my real life was becoming more dreamlike, drowsy and insignificant to me. Sometimes I dream of my home with all these extra corridors and rooms and doorways into other realms and I wake up and lay in bed for hours thinking about those places until I realize that they don't actually exist. Its not surprising, Everyday its the same thing, I wake up and just zone out until I have somewhere to be like school. Hours pass me by, often I can't even remember what I've done with the time, I'm there in my head thinking about my life and certain aspects, always thinking but never really there in the moment. I think my grasp of reality is fading, I have very little social contact with the rest of the world. Its like I'm watching my dull life as a movie now and not really living it. I don't have any friends and my family, though me and my brothers are close, seem to maintain an unspoken agreement that we should never talk about our emotions. 

My parents act like drones too, its like I don't even know who they are, all they do is watch TV all day and occasionally when times are tough they make it obvious that they hate this position their in with having spent their lives raising kids though it doesn't really bother me anymore I don't think I ever needed their acceptance I just hope they don't ever expect me to take care of them in their old age as I don't feel anything for them. Though no one wants to know as a child that their parent's are done actually caring for their children by the time they're born like they're just another item off the assembly line. As a child I always felt old, a thousand years old, not being able to relate to anyone my age, just watching and observing as if I didn't belong there at all.

I don't think I've ever felt love or cared for any other human in my life. For a short time me and this girl in high-school who I was good friends with were having sex without any actually relationship(she like weird guys and I filled the requirements) and then she suddenly cut it off, she thought I was boring and I suspect also because I was atrocious at sex. When me and her were having sex I couldn't help but think of how ridiculous the reality of the situation was, how bizarre and over romanticized the act of sex was and it was hindering my performance when all I wanted to do was enjoy myself. So the only person who has ever reached out to me for a relationship thinks I'm worthless, its left me feeling pretty unmotivated to look for a girlfriend. I look into peoples eyes and they don't seem human, they're cold and calculated and often even predictable and I often think of how little It would make a difference to me if I were the only human left on the planet, it actually seems like a really nice idea as I could go anywhere I want, I feel trapped now, this house is a cage.

Its not that I don't think people aren't capable of emotions like I am its just that I feel like I would have to wade through millions of them before I could find one that was actually sentient, everyone seems so sadistic, they always have someone they hate, I don't want to hate anyone and I don't understand why everyone wants to cause so much needless drama in their life. How can people who act so sadistic be human like I am? Sometimes I get so caught up with these pondering that I forget where I am, sometimes I get so made thinking about a point in my life when someone was being unfeeling and cruel to me that I punch the air as if I were really there thinking about how it doesn't matter if they get hurt because they can't possibly be human and want to cause such pain for no reason.

 I don't think I have the guts to finish myself off as its always been a reassuring feeling ever since I was a little boy, if I had a more convenient way like a gun or a pill I wouldn't hesitate. Perhaps this was more appropriate for /r/depression but I'm starting to feel like any means of release would be sufficient.

3461,"I've lingered on this sub for sometime nowI must admit, as I do for many things because of the fortunate circumstances I was born into and currently benefit from, that the majority of people experience far worse hardships. Even then, I cannot derive any comfort from that notion. For far too long I have lead myself to believe that I'd achieve something. That I will eventually take hold of my future, and aspire to do something meaningful. Can I say I've given it my all? No. Well, at the very least, have I felt satisfied in the few instances I've become invested in a certain task or something similar? No, whenever I've attempted something like maintaining a job, or increasing my GPA, I've always failed on some level. I've become so comfortable with keeping to myself that I struggle with relationships at the most basic level. I go into passive mode and just fall out of touch with those around me. Any job that requires effective communication like facing customers and putting on a smile, I flounder. I come off as some kind of socially inept weirdo on the fringe of being considered mentally handicapped. I've been openly mocked by past fellow employees, and I don't fault them for it. Some of the things I did and said would've caused me to possibly confer similar things if I were not the one perpetrating the bizarre behavior. I was so miserable when I worked at these places. A few times I wrote suicide notes while I was on break, although I never truly believed I'd follow through on anything. 
If I could succeed academically I'd probably be able to put this aside, as there might be hope I could get a job that would suit my personality. Of course, I wouldn't be relating this if I were, so what hope is there? I'm currently taking my third semester of classes at my local comm. college and I have something like a 2.6 GPA.

3465,"Peace of MindOk. Deep breath.

Victim of years of abuse. Years. I won't go into specifics because some folks are sensitive to that. From 10-16 or so.

Met a girl, settled down and got married. Things were ok for a while, I started to change according to my wife. So I told her everything. Everything. She handled it as well as could be expected and suggested therapy. Which I took. I felt no better but took it anyways.

Spent years in therapy, with no change. Found out through people that several of my numerous abusers were dead, I felt sad.

I was depressed all the time, no answer, no help. Turned away from suicide lines in Can/US because they don't help straight white men, programs for lgbt, poc and youth, but not adult men. Not here to gripe, just matter of fact.

On a work trip, I had to pull over at a rest stop to make use of the facilities, and there was another man in there, pleasuring himself. I watched for a while before getting involved (stupidly) When it was over, it felt like a weight had lifted off of me. My depression cleared.

My wife noticed the change when I got home too. I didn't tell her why. We made love for the first time in over 6 months. I never lost attraction for her just function.

Cut to two weeks later, the depression is back. And with a vengeance. I'm out for a walk trying to clear my head and shake the darkness free in nature, when I stumble upon a group of men being intimate with each other. Again I watch from the sidelines, then again I join in. Then again I feel better.

I have zero attraction to any of these men, or really any other men for that matter.  It for some reason this action, this fulfillment of some sort of trauma bond, makes me feel better for short times.

I've always been safe about it, but I can't keep leading this double life. 

I've gone without that sort of contact for 4 weeks now and I'm staring very worryingly at firearms, ropes and such.

I can't tell her this, or my therapist.

Every day I wake up and wish I had died in my sleep, sat at work ( like now ) I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up, the same thoughts are there all day every day, driving to work or coming home, seeing my 'friends', doing fun stuff, etc.

It's just constant and never ending. I don't really have anything to be sad about or depressed about I just feel like I'm in mental pain all the bloody time.

A couple of years ago I was taken under the care of a mental health crisis team and finally got to see a psychiatrist, after a few assessments the conclusion was that I have a depressive personality disorder and that it's unlikely to respond to medication (of which I've tried a lot).

This has ultimately destroyed every aspect of my life. I lost the woman I love, the one person who somewhat soothed the pain, because I couldn't commit after 7 years together mostly because I felt like there was no point when I know I'm only going to kill myself. I really wanted to be with her, marry her and spend my life with her but this overwhelming desire to die to overroad everything else.

Despite all this I'm fairly successful in business, I'm what most people consider very well off, but really this just hides whats going on under the surface.

I do occasionally talk to people about how I'm feeling, but almost nobody actually understands what I'm saying because they've never felt what I feel. I can't really talk to my best friend/ex now because she's moved on to somebody new, he's a nice guy I think and I'm glad that she's with somebody who will look after her because obviously I never could in the long run.

2. Heaven-Even if heaven is ""great,"" it involves eternity, which let's be real-I don't want to live forever. I highly doubt I can commit suicide in heaven
3. Hell-There are many definitions as to what this can be, ranging from separation from God to fire and brimstone to merely the grave...but let's assume some sort of eternal torture, taking the worst case scenario....I highly doubt one can commit suicide in hell

And there are many versions of heavens, hells, what happens when we reincarnate, and plenty of other afterlife ""options,"" but the above are the main ones people argue these days.

I was a moron. I went to college and got a degree in a useless subject and I've only earned a mountain of debt from it.

I can imagine the sort of people I'd want to hang out with and they don't really exist anywhere I've looked.

I always prepare all day, thinkig that is my last day and wait to become dark outside, so I can hang on tree outside without anybody see me. I just got on the tree the only thing I had to do is to tie the rope around the branch I was sitting and 'jump' from it.

Hopefully by then I'd've moved out from my parents' house. I'm CF and so I needn't worry about sticking around for any hypothetical children.

I just can't cope with this any more, and having a time limit ‚Äî it makes things easier. I can't live in a system as restrictive, as rigid, as oppressive as this one. Nothing will change either, given that people ‚Äî myself included ‚Äî are too afraid to take a stand. 

There's too much suffering, and there's hardly anything to show for it. There's austerity and homelessness; domestic violence (against both men and women) and mental illnesses ‚Äî and so many other issues I can't pinpoint from the top of my head.

My family will mourn, of course. 

I was never made for this world. I'm flimsy, talentless, and just below average looking. I'm a constant anxious, depressed, and incompetent mess.

3544,"What is wrong with me?I'm not someone who has ever had difficulty with people. I've had plenty of friends and girlfriends in my life, some of whom are still obsessed with me. I've always been good with people. I've never had an issue with getting people to care for me. I'm a sociable and endearing person. I'm fairly popular and well liked. 

And yet here I am. Constantly at a distance. Constantly at odds. I struggle with people because nobody seems as off centre as I do. Everyone laughs and thinks I'm joking when I talk about offing myself. They think it's another one of my jokes. But I think about it all the time. Every day, from the start the the end. I think about ending it. I've even blatantly told friends before, and nobody takes me seriously. 

I'm decently attractive and have never had an issue getting women to take an interest in me. And by all means, I'm pretty well off financially. But that makes it worse. Why? Because I've been successful, nobody takes my struggles seriously. It's just another one of my jokes. But I daydream about being dead. I constantly think about everything being done and finished. And not casually. It's all that fills my head. Every day. 

It just seems surreal sometimes. No matter how many people I meet and talk to, nobody seems to understand where I am in my life. Or what I'm trying to imply. I feel disconnected and distanced from people who think they understand me. I feel separate. I want to die. I think about it all the time. The world seems cheap. Nobody cares, and I don't expect them to. Everyone is disposable and self consumed, and I'm no exception. 

I drink almost constantly throughout the day. I do any drug I can get my hands on. It's never been because I like to ""party. It's because I want it to be over. I feel like I've been trying to hint about my issues through it, but nobody really pays much attention. Nobody cares. Nobody catches onto the fact that I'm deliberately trying to off myself in the most subtle way possible. Like maybe if I OD my family won't be as heartbroken. They'd see it as an accident. 

But no matter how many times I take too much, I survive. So I think about taking a more direct approach. And again, no matter how many times I talk about it, people think I'm just joking around. 

Recently I've been having chronic pain all over and have been treating it with heroin, alcohol, and whatever else seems to take my mind off of it. If it dulls me mentally, it helps. It doesn't hurt as much if I don't think. Nothing else seems to help it. I need that distraction or I'm full of aches and pain. 

I know that this is long but I don't know what else to say. I'm just so tired of being down. I'm tired of acting like nothing is wrong. I feel like I'm almost at a point where everything is unbearable. I dread waking up every day. I want everything to be done. I want to cross the street at the wrong time. All of that. The idea consumes me. I have a gun in my house, and it's all I can do to not use it. 

I can't avoid being consumed by whatever it is that holds me. I'm just done. I don't want to be in pain anymore or have people see my issues as as joke. I've spent more than enough time looking down the barrel of my own gun. Something has to give, in either direction.¬†¬†¬† 

As it is, I'm more prepared for death than anything else. I live in a sort of fear of the night that I finally get carried away. Recently I've been spending most of my days sleeping and trying to isolate myself. I feel like I'm always getting closer, but part of me wants to avoid it. I feel like there's no excuse because there's plenty of people worse off than me, but it still stays on my mind every day. ",suicide

3564,"I can't do thisLife is getting too real for me too fast. I can't be the one to figure out how to pay the bills. I can't be my mother's caretaker. I can't lead this family unit in a direction that will keep us afloat. I just can't.

 I can't stay positive in the face of this much adversity. I can't be a part of figuring out real life solutions using real life knowledge and wisdom. I can't be a leader or even a part of this team, but what am I going to do? Abandon everyone? I can't do that, and I have nowhere else to go. 

I don't want to be the teacher of life skills that will get others through the harsh life that is ahead. I don't want the responsibility to teach them to rest on me. I don't want the responsibility to learn as much as I can and to work as hard as is necessary for us all to make it to rest on me. 

I also don't want to work in a team where all of these responsibilities have to be figured out and delegated and such. I can't do this. I'm not strong enough to do this. I just want to run away, but there is nowhere to run to. I don't want to be a part of the military. I just don't want to do what is absolutely necessary to make it. I don't even really want to figure out how to make it. Life has been too easy for too long. Now it feels like every little choice I make, how I spend every little second, is going to be the difference between making it and not making it. There is no ""things will naturally work out on their own."" That's not how this works. 

I don't see anyway out but through, but I don't want to go through. I don't want to suddenly become emotionally responsibile for my family. I don't want to be anyone's ""rock.""

I need to escape. I cannot handle the life which has been set before me. I cannot handle life as it is in general. I don't want to be a part of this mess. I can't be. I'm too used to coasting along, not worried about having my basic needs met, or having to take care of anyone, or having to teach anyone, or having to be emotionally responsibile to anyone.

But there is no way out. I have been able to think more clearly now due to better life choices than I've been able to for a very long time. The truth is, I am horribly immature. I'm just now figuring out who I am at 23. I'm constantly worrying about things that fucking teenagers handle way before they ever graduate high school. 

I don't want to embrace this journey. I don't want to look forward to an intense period of great personal growth and struggle. I can't handle the responsibility of it all. I've just been ignoring it for so long, desperately hoping my parents would be able to pull through of their own accord while I and my siblings get our shit together. There's no time for that anymore. There's no time for no taking anything seriously anymore. There is only time for the real life of learning and responsibilities that is set before us, and I can't do this. I can't even properly act like I've got everything under control like a real fucking mam for my own desperate mother. I can't do this. I've failed at becoming a real man, and now I'm backing away from the challenge. 

I don't know. So much of my time and mental energy is spent on things that just don't matter. Things I don't even really bother to understand, like politics, or watching topical shit on YouTube, which in the end I don't even really learn from. 

Life itself is far too great a thing for me to be able to deal with. To learn from experience is something I've really been struggling with, and now that I've quit weed and able to have more real forethought, everything I know that life
must be is too much. I very well may have just fried my brain. I don't want to keep on going. I don't know what to do. I just can't happily embrace what life is, now that I've become more clear in my mind. 

Life is too daunting to put my real mental
energy into living. I can't even take responsibility for holding myself emotionally accountable. I am too far gone.  I can't willingly grasp the real hardships of life. I've spent so long dissociated from reality, that it's become too much to handle now that I'm back. To just shift my attitude to a positive one...to a more stoic rather than anxious one...I don't know if I can grow that much. I don't think I have it in me to really take the reins and shift my attitude about it. I'm pathetic in that way. I know exactly what it is I need to do to embrace all of this head on and come out on top. I don't need someone else to tell me how to grow up, or that I need to, or why I need to...I just... can't.",suicide

3574,"Im not okay right now.[17/F]

I've been depressed for probably nearly half my life now. At this point it's hard to imagine being happy. Every day I see my friends living a carefree life, but every single thing I fucking do is ruined by either anxiety or just not being able to get myself off the couch. 

Somewhere during the last schoolyear my anxiety got to the point where I had panic attacks basically every other day, I ended up not going to school for over six months and I told myself it would be better afterwards. Suprise, it isn't. I don't see a future for myself, I don't know how I'm ever going to get anywhere because I'm fucking useless and there's litterally nothing to change about it. The past few weeks I've been thinking about suicide basically every day. Imagining how happy I would be to just let myself fall out of the window. 

It's been this bad before, but back then I always felt more of a barrier holding me back. Right now I have no clue how to go on. 

I'm lucky to have a supportive family, but I don't know how to convey that I don't want their comforting. I simultaneously want to suffer, and want the suffering to end. I'm so lost right now and I don't know what to do. 

I have no clue why I'm posting this, but I just want to get it off my chest.",suicide

I'm surprised I'm still doing these updates, I honestly thought I would of given up after like one or two posts. This is a new achievement for me. 

First of all I just want to say thank you for all your support and concern, Ive had a lot of messages asking if I seen therapists or psychologists and yes, plenty! Tbh I think it's countless how many professionals Ive seen for my mental health. 

Anyway today was pretty unsuccessful. I didnt go to work, I slept all day and spent all day on my pc playing The Division and lying to everyone I know. I was suppose to see my ex tonight for a movie after work but I told him I was working too late and wasnt feeling up to it. Another guy from work who is obsessed with me also asked if I would see him for coffee and I ignored his message. 
Seeing people makes me so uncomfortable. 

I blocked both of them on my social media, including steam and just played games all day. 

That's it. My day was a typical day for me; ignore everyone and distract myself with games. 
I thought about death only once today and it was about how I'm going to tell my Mum. She hasnt contacted me directly (except through legal letters) in about a month so I'm sure she won't care I'm gone or already thinks i am. Eh, I might leave it alone and not tell her. 
I also need to some how work up the mental strength to go outside and simply get a note pad and pen so I can start writing my goodbye letters to those who I feel needs one. 
It's silly that I have to mentally prepare myself to be in public, I get so anxious and think everyone is staring at me or judging me. I feel so stupid. I can't even get groceries, I usually just get food delivered but it chews through my cash. 
Anyway, I said I wouldn't make this as long as I did yesterday so as always, good vibes to you all. ",suicide

I love the idea of people looking back to the thought of me and mourning. She was gone so soon. God wanted one of his angels back etc etc that sappy shit. I love it so much.

3606,"I‚Äôve become nothing but the physical embodiment of depression, self-hate, and rage for others. I want to die.How do cisgender men and cisgender women enjoy intercourse simultaneously? If so, how?

Men want pressure and the vagina to be ‚Äútight‚Äù so that it will close up and/or push them out. If the vaginal muscles are tight, it means that the woman is tense and/or scared. For men to enjoy intercourse, the woman would need to be scared during.

But for the woman to enjoy intercourse, she‚Äôd need to be lubricated, aroused, and experience vaginal tenting (the elongation and widening and loosening of the vagina.)

But that would ruin it for the man because the vagina wouldn‚Äôt be closing up and tight and pushing them out anymore.

How do people enjoy life? How do they have sex? How do they get an ounce of pleasure from anything? I want my pain to go away. I want it to be over.

I have tried and tried to live a happy life, but it just never works out. I have unrealistic expectations of what life should be I guess. I am a complete failure as a son, a brother, a father and a husband. I have tried to keep hope for the future alive, but all hope is to me now is torture. 

I was talking with a co-worked last week and it finally hit me, all the things I had given up or put off so I could do what was right by my family will now never be realized. My body is broken and can never be fixed. I lost all hope that day.  I tried to explain it to my wife, she basically said ""so what, your not the only one"". 

I guess she's right, who gives a shit what I want. I am only here to make money to pay bills so that other may live and dream. 

so tired of the pain, so tired of being alone in my head. 

Wish I had the strength to end it all, but I dont. Feel too guilty for the pain I know it would cause. I have people the love and care for me, just dont care for myself anymore and they cant understand my pain. I dont kill myself because I dont want to burden my wife and sons with what it would cause them even though I know they would all be better off without me. 

I am an anchor around my wifes neck, holding her back, ruining her life. I have nothing left to offer my sons expect as a cautionary tail of how not to live. I am nothing but a financial and emotional burden to those around me. 

feel alone, no hope, just want to die.",suicide
3653,"My Story.I've literally just joined Reddit and decided to more or less myfirst post/comment, (from r/survivorsofabuse), here.  I'm using it because I'm not sure whether I have the energy to type something new.  I'll probably add a little more here and there though.

I was groomed when I was 15.  I had just finished my GCSEs (poorly), whilst struggling with a drug addict parent.  This parent would often go missing for 24 hours, act erratically and let me and the other parent down.  Thanks to a rather several severe alterations during the few months prior/during my exams, I lost faith in myself and began struggling to cope.  I was weak, I know.  (My A Levels went more or less the same way).  I began blaming myself for this parents problems, thanks to said alterations.  And so began my fall as a human.

I met Him during our family vacation to Australia.  It lasted throughout my stay and after I left (thanks to the internet).  I knew I was being groomed and I allowed it to happen - I was pretty depressed and felt ugly/alone/unloved - (even though part of me knew I wasn't alone or unloved) - with Him I felt loved/sexy, so I let it him break me down.  Then he just left me.  So I started seeking out other men like Him.  Overtime I began to associate abuse with love/attraction.  The more abusive they were, the more beautiful/the more loved I felt.  

Time passed and I fell even further.  I encountered men who enjoyed treating me like an 'object', a 'faggot', a 'sand nigger', a slave.  I soon found out that these men  were the most abusive.  So I actively started searching for men with that mindset.  Soon I began to believe that I was nothing, just like they all told me.  I found myself subjecting my mind/body to repulsive/humiliating acts, because I wanted to please them.  Because I wanted to be loved.  Because to me abuse was love.  Because the abuse meant I was attractive.  When I hit my 18th birthday I realised I had lost the ability to feel.  I have forgotten what true happiness feels like.  I have virtually no patience, very little empathy and effectively understanding of human emotions.  Thankfully I learnt how to fake it.  I put on a mask in front of everyone.  I'm now that 'bubbly, crazy guy'.  Every so often the mask cracks and my true nature is revealed.  But I'm good at brushing over it;  manipulating people to ignore it;  manipulating them to do what I want.  I also began seducing women - I was desperate to form a REAL connection - to feel REAL love.   

Now I'm nearly 19, and I've been abused by so many men I've lost count.  I've slept with so many women I've lost count.  I now hate children and find myself repulsed by their innocence.  Yet a tiny part of me does want a beautiful wife and even maybe children...one day.  But deep down I know that's never gonna happen.  I know I'm going to die unloved and alone.  

Right now, as I look in the mirror, I don't recognise myself.  I have no hobbies, no interests and usually very few emotions.  Once in a blue moon I do feel - I feel everything all at once.  And then I'll be exhausted and depressed for a while, until the circle restarts.  If I'm honest, today is one of those days.  

I cut myself because I have no control over anything in my life.  I can't control my need to be hurt, which is still there, bubbling under the surface.  Sometimes, I think to myself, 'Find another Alpha to worship;  you deserve to be broken/abused by a real man - it's why you were born'.  

I know I'm pathetic, weak and undeserving.  I know I shouldn't be posting here, because I should be seen and not heard.  I know what I've 'gone through' is nothing compared to what other people endure.  I'm sorry if my post and my weakness angers you.  I'm sorry that what I've been going on about for ages is nothing.  I know I should stay in my lane and shut up but I just can't.   It's like there's a little voice inside of that's screaming to be heard - it wants this all to stop.  I'm exhausted.  I can't keep living like this, even though the other voice, the one begging to be abused, is getting louder.  I feel like there's only one option and that is Death.  I mean isn't Death just the finish line?  The one we've been running to since birth? 

Admitting that doesn't scare/upset me.  What does is that I feel like Death is the only logical/pragmatic solution.  One less stain on the Earth.  One less failure of a son/grandson/brother.  The only way to know and feel true Peace and Purpose.  As I've been whining to all of you, I've begun to realise that this post is meant to be my 'note' to society.  Not that anyone should care.  You all have better things to do that are more deserving of your time.  I'm just being selfish as usual.  Using people for my own sick gain.

3665,"I do not have anything worth living for anymoreI've been beset by a lot of problems/difficulties in my life and there's a part of me that wants to live and there's a part that wants to die. I just want the problems to simply just vanish and never appear again, and my problems have made me lose the will to fight any longer.

Simply put, I have Aspergers. I'm 20 years old, and I think I've just about had it with my life. Yes I've had challenges with my Aspergers condition, yes I have done things that I'm not too proud of, but my parents, teachers and peers alike have subjected me to bitter verbal abuse, humiliation and several uncomfortable situations to make me feel unhappy and upset for who I am. My parents felt I was too difficult to deal with and they continued to literally disown me and subject me to harsh treatment.

Even as I joined a fraternity to escape the harsh treatment, my fraternity brothers have continued to do things to screw me over rather than accept the way I am. They took issue with me not opening up as much and forced me into drinking and coming to their parties, and when I asked them for help with a date to our formal, one of my brothers spread a rumor that I wanted to ask her out.

Everybody and everything wants to be against me so better I do die than to move on with my life. Nobody will understand me, nobody will take me seriously, nobody believes my Asperger's so why bother fighting when every resource that I have used has been exhausted?

I don't want to forgive and I don't want my offenders to rest in peace. This is a terrible world after all; all I have is three options: Suicide, Cope Up, or live with it. Maybe suicide is a better option for me since I'm done with everything.

Maybe life isn't worth it anymore, since I don't have anything to live for. I'm too weak to move on, I'm bleeding with the amount of bullet holes riddled in me because of what people have done to me. I even called the suicide hotline 20-25 times because of my problems, and counseling didn't even help at all.

3666,"I just don't know where to go anymore.I'm so fucking tired of everything that is part of my life. More and more I keep succumbing to insanity and hopelessness. I recover, because I'm mentally strong. But I always return to this dreadful state. The time between being happy and unimaginably sad becomes shorter every time. My mental strength is fading. My bucket of hope is down to its last few drops. 

There is too much going on in my life and I can't take it on alone anymore. That is the problem. I've always been practically on my own. Left to my own self. In my entire 26 years of living I've never met anyone that I could really connect with. And If I did make any friends that I could connect with, the friendship would somehow water down over time. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this post. I'm so confused and plagued by all kinds of thoughts and worry that I can't write a coherent post anymore. Almost everything I try to undertake ends in either mediocrity or failure. I work so damn hard to make something of my life but every time life turns around the corner to kick me in the balls and crush my face into the ground. 

I'm not a real man. In my 26 years of living no woman has ever been interested in me. I can't see why since I'm not ugly or have a bad personality that I know of. Yet apparently nobody wants me. There is just something about me that turns women off. That's the conclusion I'm coming to. Never kissed a woman, been loved by one, never hugged or had deep conversations about life. Never made love. And yes I've date people and such, I'm not the kind of guy you think I am. I don't live under a rock or anything. Not that it would matter. I see all kinds of people ending up in relationships. Only I don't. 

I only have a few friends. One hand is more than enough to count them on. I know quite a lot of people and have a decent social life, but I just always feel like there is a glass wall between me and everyone else. Every time I put myself in a vulnerable position, I get hurt.  

I'm truly tired of life. I truly am. I don't know where to turn to anymore. I don't know what to hope for anymore. Hope for me, has always turned out to be a thing that only enhances my inevitable pain. And I just want the pain to stop.

I've come to despise the happy careless people that act like life is some sort of party and everything is fantastic. They seem to have everything worked out, but didn't have to do very much for it.  People like that have just been dealt good cards and don't know about the true world that surrounds them. Reality is a very cold and heartless place to be in for some people. I've stopped talking about my problems to a certain person from my family I trust a lot. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems anymore. 

I just want to be loved by someone for who I am. That, I've learned, is not a possibility. I don't know how or why, but I seem to be broken and unattractive.

There's a constant screaming in my head to end it.  I can't look at my wrists without wanting to slice them wide open, or get a new prescription without looking up how many of the pills it would take to kill me.  Not that I would try either of those, I'd opt for a less painful experience.

I don't have that feeling of relief yet that people talk about, once they decide to actually do it, so I guess that means I'm not quite there.  If I was I suppose I wouldn't bother posting here at all.

3696,"Nietzsche: for the Interested and Depressed   Let me begin by dispelling a common misconception; Nietzsche is not a nihilist. If you associate him with nihilism, dear reader, it may be easier for you to understand what I am about to say if you pretend that you have never heard the name of Friedrich Nietzsche.

   I find that many individuals come to a point where they stop, look around, and realize that they are a mouse in a labyrinth hunting for cheese; however, not only do they seem to be losing the game, but they don't quite see the point of even playing. They find that everything around them is an false image. So much phoniness surrounds them with no escape. Then they look at themselves and find that they have nothing to live for. Congratulations friend, if this is you, you have stumbled upon the dark truth of man. You have made it half the way the way there, but I feel you have one more conclusion to draw that will return purpose to your life! 
	
   Beginning with the arguments of Plato, Socrates, and other Greek philosophers, the original purpose of man was to follow a telos, a goal to seek the purest form of the self. For these thinkers, there was a pure form of justice, of triangles, of logic, and of man that were concealed by images projected by the objects themselves and by culture, and only through argumentation can one find these Forms in a sort of team-effort. This sort of thinking provides, at the very least, a basis for morals and is the foundation for the character we try to instill in children. Remember, even before you started school, how your mothers tried to teach you to be honest and kind as though they were inherent characteristics of man. 
	
   Eventually, people began to question the existence of these Forms such as Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Joseph Conrad, among others. Each of them provided their alternatives to these forms. Likewise, you, seeker of truth, have found that the forms in and of themselves are lies, and it is here you, Nietzsche, Conrad, Holden Caufield, and Hamlet have found common ground; however, it is time to move back from the abyss and find a role and participate in the grand play of this world. 
	
   Nietzsche provides a solution for this issue. Beginning with the given that ALL morality is a fiction, a construct of society, rather than attempting to distinguish truth from fiction, the distinction must be made between fiction and better fiction. Fictions range from an appreciation of Mozart and the Golden Rule to playing hockey or going to the club. But with no grounding for even this quest for fictions, it begs the question, ‚ÄúWhy bother with these fictions?‚Äù The answer is, ‚ÄúThat is life!‚Äù A life consists of a collection of actions, of doing, of being, of finding whatever interests you, KNOWING THAT IT IS NOT TRUE. Football, for example, consists men running about attempting to move a pigskin and tackling each other, but millions of people have adopted this fiction and made the rules a part of their lives. Conrad expresses the pursuit of better fictions as turning to ‚Äúwork.‚Äù Work is any activity that produces a better understanding of the self and that provides joy. 
	
   While science has discovered that we are a bunch of atoms, you can do nothing with that information! Unless of course, you are a biochemist. 
	
   I haven't expressed all that I would have liked due to homework that I've been putting off, please comment with questions, comments, hate, love, criticism, and I will try to answer accordingly.
   
   TL;DR You may have realized that the truth is we are a bunch of atoms; however, the point of life is not necessarily to find truth but to find more ways to enjoy life and provide substance for it.

But I know I can't change it, even if I were to transition, I would never pass. I'm already 6'3 and have massive fucking limbs and broad shoulders. My facial features are way too masculine and amount of hormones is going to change the fact that I was born a guy. That I'll never be a real woman. That even if I were to transition, I'd have to live a life of fear just because I'm black and trans. I feel like I lose either way, that either way I go, I still end up miserable. I'll never be someones wife or mother, I'll forever be this gigantic freak who wishes they were a woman. I wish that I could be a normal teenage girl for just one day, but I can't and no amount of wishing to an unforgiving god is going to make that happen. I'll forever be mocked and ridiculed, called slurs, and quite possibly assaulted or even murdered. It doesn't help that my grandparents hate trans people, and my parents used to make fun of them. I fucking hate this rural fucking state, I hate everything about it. It won't matter for to much longer though, I'm going to kill myself on Friday.

3714,"My name's Theodore. This is my confession.Let me begin with a disclaimer that I've never used Reddit before and I'm not privy to any existing protocol meant to be followed. English isn't my first language. And mine's a life I wouldn't wish on my worst of enemies.

My name's Theo, and I'm 23 years old. I feel human, though recurring patterns of slightly different, yet monotonously repetitive encounters with some of you make me question that judgment. At times, I feel as lonely and depressed as someone in my position deserves to feel. In others, I dismiss those thoughts as facetious musings of an idle mind. Ever since my childhood years I've felt a gaping disconnect with my peers that's bored a life-sized hole in my sanity; the depths of which would be impossible to define. I took out my rage whenever I could - the only possible way I could - on stray animals which I'd convinced my mother to be allowed into our home. I've harmed many. Wounded more. And killed beyond counting. This, despite never harbouring any intention to hurt;  some of them I'd raised myself. I punched two holes in a baby sparrow's lungs before releasing it, somewhat shocked at what I'd done. It died in mere seconds, squealing as it left behind a bloody mess. I mauled a young pigeon - smashing its round head against my window repeatedly. Mother found its half-eaten carcass returning from work. I also incapacitated my pet rabbit for life once when I was home alone - its only fault being an infectiously bubbly, if slightly excessive enthusiasm. I've lost count of my sickly exploits, but have been blessed enough to have been delivered from those memories and urges in recent times. All this was merely my past - I haven't harmed anything for the past three years. And no one's ever found out.

I've been reasonably aloof throughout the course of my life, my only lens of looking at the world being an unrestrained, unhealthy, and desperate envy. I've hated as much as I've craved with a passion, the maddening happiness that I see in two lovers' eyes. Deep, meaningful, impossibly close relationships. Depraved and manic I may be deemed, but I've always wished, yearned, begged and prayed for that one little ounce of humanity. I've dared only to love once, but was denied. By her fear of me being the monster I seem. My inability to convince her otherwise left me all the more miserable. ""I could be electrifying but possess no morals."" I still glance through her texts on occasion, cherishing her refreshingly youthful, humble innocence. Though I might eventually have killed it. Jk.

None of my other relationships have lasted a year and I'd always preferred it that way. I've always craved something more. Something most people couldn't put a finger on. I've never been bullied or abused, nor have I hurt anyone, but I've always been the distant, unfeeling stranger who observed with a lustful envy - a world he couldn't experience. I'm a monster in a world of men, a monster who wants to love more than any man ever could. Dear Reddit, what do I deserve? ",suicide

However that is not the only reason i'm here,i am used to being lonely,since my childhood really,i don't like it,but i have adapted to it.

3721,"I deserve this.Two days ago, I got into my dream university on full academic scholarship after a really tough year and a half. A year and a half ago, I left my normal high school, where I had a decent social life with people I had known all of my life, to go to an alternative school so I could graduate early. I graduate at 15 in July. I completed 52 credits at my local community college in two semesters and I am 16 right now. I took all online classes so I do not have any friends in community college. I also wouldn't fit in with them, I'm only 16. 

My parents think I'm inadequate because I hang out with my friends too much but truth is, I only have 2 friends left and I constantly feel like a burden to them because I always want to hang out with them since they are all I have. My 2 friends think I am inadequate because I am shallow, they have been ignoring me ever since I told them I got into my dream university. I think it's because I was too proud but I wanted to be because I always feel inadequate to them because I chose a different route in life and they think it's easier. I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others and it comes off as pride. I am not an interesting person because I don't actually have a personality, I surround myself with all these achievements because I am nothing without them. I am so alone. I alienated my friends, they are sick of me because all I am is just a resume. 

 I am trying to convince myself that this is just a rough patch and everything will get better but it's getting so hard and I'm getting so tired. What if I don't deserve real friends because I'm so shallow? What if I never have a good personality and am just a long list of achievements?

3722,"Life is too muchIn the last 5 years my life has been hell. Went into business with family aged 21, got fucked over,  cheated and ripped off by a lot of people, nearly had my marriage split up over it. My stress and anxiety levels have been cranked up to the max for so long, I don't remember what happy feels like. My family betrayed me and abandoned me, haven't even bothered to contact me in over a year.

I bought a house with my husband, I thought having something to focus on would make me better. It was a terrible idea, the house is so fucked. I think I'm going to go bankrupt trying to fix it. My husband moved to the other side of the world for a new job, and I'm meant to go over too so I have two weeks to try and finish it, find a renter and get ready to move to a different country and I just don't see it happening. Ive already injured myself trying to do all the work that needs a team by myself.

Basically I feel like I should just give up now. I keep trying and I either fuck it up or get screwed over and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of putting on a happy face, I'm sick of being positive for other people and I'm sick of being in pain all the time. I want to finish it but I don't want to upset whoever will find me, that is literally the only thing that stopped me tonight. Still trying to be too damn considerate of other people.

I contemplate suicide every day, usually as soon as I wake up... as if it was already on my mind while I slept. How come I get up and drag myself out the house every day to work, then school... ?

Because I know to be saved I have to save myself... nobody is going to do it for me. Nobody is going to think I'm worth anything unless I become worth something, nobody is going to love me until they can't live without me. 

So that's what it is... my own personal rebellion. I'm gonna prove  those people who used me and mock me and don't care weather I live or die that they're wrong... killing myself would only prove them right. So instead I'm going to show them I am a smart, strong, determined person who the world can't tear down. I'll fight, I won't lay down and die like they want me to. I'm going to become something just to spite them, to prove them wrong... maybe secretly tho... I'm gonna do it just for myself, because I know I'm worth it.

I've been having problems with education and my social life as far as I can remember. It is only now that these problems have intensified to the extent where my life has become a disorganized mess. I have been to several councilors in high school to help keep myself up to date with homework and coursework. Since I've started university I have fallen behind on my work and social life. My dorm room was covered with post-it notes and reminders on my walls, I was forgetting to complete and hand in coursework. I've been receiving letters from my tutors who are concerned about my progress. At the end of last term it was too much and I had a breakdown.

I went to see my doctor about the problems i've been having, he was not much help so he is referring me to a psychiatrist. I'm now on a six month waiting list. I have not discussed any of my problems with my parents as I'm afraid of disappointing them. They will be furious at me for destroying an opportunity to a good career and life. I feel like this is beyond my control now. I've wasted a lot on my cost of living and tuition fees. I lost a lot of friends I have made by being selfish and neglecting them.

My professor constantly mentions plagiarism and how it's wrong (which I do agree with,) but literally every quiz he makes is plagiarized from some quizlet he finds online, I'm fine with it because it makes studying and cheating on the quizzes the easiest thing ever, but that's pretty hypocritical.

I tell myself this is only for a limited duration, that it will all be OK once I graduate, but could I be dealing myself some kind of long-term mental harm by being in a program that is so bad that I consider ending my life just to escape it?

3735,"This just in: Four new Undertale AUs now in progress simultaneously! I started VGamer1991 Studios about four or five years ago when I was attempting to use GameMaker 8.1 (yes, the Windows 8.1 version of the same program initially used to create Undertale) to take a crack at writing my first original video game. The project quickly folded, however, when I realized a completely original project was too much for me to take on with no experience in programming, despite the fact that GameMaker is marketed as being easy to use even with absolutely zero experience. The game was gone and all public mention of my studio was quickly wiped off the radar but I kept the dream and the related goals alive in my heart. I may or may not revive the original project as there are people out there who would be interested in playing it but it was never meant to be a sort of game that anyone outside of a particular group would get into. Undertale is for everyone and I have hacked games in the past, so I think I‚Äôm much better off starting at a point that is obviously closer to my comfort zone.

Here, however, come not one, nor two, nor three, but FOUR new Undertale AUs. One, which I am calling Frisk‚Äôs New Home, was an idea I got fairly early on when I realized I was not quite happy with vanilla Undertale. Another, Getting Revenge Together, is a customized version of Undertale Together that has ties with another AU I‚Äôm making. The third, Diana‚Äôs New Home, is a further customized version of Frisk‚Äôs New Home in which the character looks more like me, but this AU could also be seen as the prequel to my final AU, Don‚Äôt Let This Happen, which tells the story of Diana (the title character of the previous AU), who ran away from the human world entirely after she came out of an abusive relationship with Derek, the ~~~protagonist~~~ antagonistic player character in this AU. Don‚Äôt Let This Happen forms the basis for the previous two while Frisk‚Äôs New Home was something I thought up separately.

After deciding to make Frisk‚Äôs New Home I always knew I wanted to redo Undertale Together but my mind hadn‚Äôt yet fully formed the idea of Don‚Äôt Let This Happen. Once that idea did form, however, it was only natural that Diana‚Äôs New Home was the topping of choice with which to ice the cake, after the final piece of the puzzle that has become Getting Revenge Together was in place.

I will reveal that the title of Don‚Äôt Let This Happen comes from the fact that Derek finds that Diana has committed suicide after being relentlessly tormented by the memories of what Derek put her through when they were a couple living on the Surface (similar to how it seems likely Chara also committed suicide canonically), and it is also a warning to me, the AU‚Äôs creator, to not let my fellow humans down by committing suicide (since I have honestly struggled with depression and suicidal ideation since I was eight years old and it has only gotten worse over the years, as within the past decade I was with someone who wasn‚Äôt good for me and they put me through things that I then based the early storyline on).

Getting Revenge Together is based off of a sort of True Pacifist run of Don‚Äôt Let This Happen, where Diana and her new lover, Aidan, come back to the Underground after Derek goes there to live in exile when he gets tired of life in the village where he had already been living in exile on the Surface.

3748,"We are all just ticking time bombsDeath is inevitable. However, living here at home is driving me towards ending my life much earlier than expected. 

Growing up, I had a pretty decent childhood. Both parents were present, in a way. My dad was always working to provide for us. So whenever I'd have to talk to my dad, it was usually for punishment. 

My parents provided a lot of things for my sisters and me, such as a house, food, clothes, etc. However, they were never there for us emotionally. I don't ever remember being asked how I was feeling or how my day went. I never really had anyone to talk to, so all of these emotions were suppressed.

Fast forward years later, and both of my parents have ran out of patience. I'm my dad's least favorite. He always claims that he loves all of us equally, but that's not true. There was a saying that stuck to me, ""The axe forgets, but the tree remembers.""

I'll never forget some of the things that my dad has done. Where he prefers my sisters over me.

Fast forward a few years later, my two younger sisters are always against me. My dad always chooses their side, and I'm just so tired. I get yelled at for defending myself. There's so much going on right now. I'd rather end it all now.

Anyways, thank you all of taking the time to read this long post. I appreciate you all.",suicide

3750,"I'm just so tired of it allI have been struggling with chronic pain for 25 years since I was 14. I worked so hard at everything then and had a lot of good teachers and coaches that helped me to be excel. I lived in a small town and was from a small town where everybody knew me and my family and I always had a lot of pressure to be great at whatever I did and my best was never good enough. If I got a single B on my report card my parents would focus and that and why it wasn't perfect while other siblings that never even tried got rewarded if they didn't fail any classes. I was always doing more than my peers because I wanted to live up to the expectations others had for me. My 8th grade year I went undefeated in wrestling because I had a great coach who was happy with however I did. He was just as happy for everyone on the team when they gave their best no matter if they only won a single match all year and I thought that was great. He was the best and came from a foster home and just wanted to help kids have fun and treated everyone like they mattered and that's why I was so successful under him. The summer after that season my dad signed me up for several wrestling camps and after I asked him not to. I was a perfectionist and had been to several of these camps before and they push children to their breaking point and my parents could never understand that. So I went and did 3 wrestling camps that summer as I recall that were ran by middle aged guys that had gone to the Olympics and they were brutal and I would work out contantly  even when not in the camps because that is the kind of person I was. During camp I injured my neck and shoulder severely and laid on the mat thinking I was paralyzed from it and it took a lot of effort to even wiggle my fingers. Nobody even came over to check on me and eventually I stood up but my head just wobbled around like an infant learning to use its muscles. I managed to work up the strength to get through the camp and not miss any of it by just flexing every muscle I could to support my neck. When I went home and told my parents instead of taking me to the hospital they just had an argument about it. I had disclocated some ribs too and could see them protruding from my sternum. I continued wrestling while in school but was never the same after that. I took one year off after my sister died in a traffic accident because I didn't care anymore. The high school coach pulled me out of spanish class when I didn't show up for the first practice lecture me on how I was being a quitter and I would regret it. I just ignored him and went home and cried as I did often. That year off my dad finally took me to the family doc who just said it was a pulled muscle and to get physical therapy. I did everything that was asked of me and more and it didn't help. Then came chiropratic care which thankfully enabled me to turn my head again but the burning stabbing pain and the headaches from it were still constant. I just told myself that once I graduate from college and got out of this small town I'd find a doc with a brain that could help. I'd never had an MRI or even an x-ray and it was frustrating. Eventually I graduated and got a job and got married to a very kind person who was determined to help me. I've been to so many family docs, massage therapists accupuncture, surgeons, pain management docs and I can't even remember what else. After my first surgery a decade ago I had to quit my job because I couldn't even raise my dominant arm. When I was working before the surgery I would have to lay on the floor of my office for a couple hours a day to try to relieve the pain. I eventually was diagnosed with a severe labral tear, herniated discs throughout my entire cervical spine, arthritis in my neck, and radiculopathy that causes numbness in my arm. I have been living a spoonie life for a long time. If I don't do much during the day I can keep my pain at manageable levels but if I do anything that involves turning my head or using my dominant shoulder the pain quickly becomes unmanageable. When the pain is at a 9 or 10 I become suicidal and just want it to stop and to avoid the feelings I avoid doing much of anything to keep my pain down. Just carrying in groceries or doing computer work (my previous occupation) for an hour gets my pain out of whack.  I applied for disability insurance a few months ago and was denied. The independent company that made the determination sent me a letter saying to call if I had any questions or other info to supply and I called two or three times on different days and they wouldn't even answer the phone or return my call. They then proceeded to deny my application saying I wasn't disabled 5 years ago when I have been dealing with this for 25 years and had over a 100 pages of doctor notes covering the last 10 years of my medical history. I am so depressed right now as a result and am just tired of fighting this and don't see the point of living. I always wanted children but didn't have any because I didn't feel I could adequately take care of them since I can barely take care of myself. My wife wants me to get a lawyer and fight it but I am just so tired. I contacted one last night via chat then called them today and they didn't answer. I have called the suicide hotline a few time previously and am discouraged my the automated system that answers and hang up after waiting a couple minutes. Nobody seems to understand what I deal with on a daily basis except my wife who has watched me struggle with it every damn day, waking several times a night from severe pain over the past 15 years. I am lucky to have a loving wife that works hard to support us but I feel so guilty and useless and my pain wears on her too and isn't fair to her. She shouldn't have to put up with somebody like me. I love her so much but sometimes she gets overwhelmed and wants to leave for good and I understand. I am so depressed and have cut myself with razors just to see what it feels like. The pain from cutting is like nothing compared to the pain I feel constantly and is actually a nice distraction from my usual pain. I have considered swallowing all of my prescription meds but don't want to hurt the docs that prescribed them to me by doing that and don't want to hurt other patients who depend on these meds wither. I have also choked myself with my belt a few times and have been so close to killing myself over the years but don't want to cause my wife any more pain than I already have, she doesn't deserve that. If it wasn't for her I would probably be dead by now but that is an awful lot of pressure to put on her. I don't think I am going to kill myself now but am just having another hard time with a lot of suicidal thoughts and don't feel like I can take much more of this at the moment. We recently had to move across the country to a suburb of a major city and I hate it. It is so noisy all the time and I can't get any peace and quiet anywhere. I used to be able to drive a couple minutes to the river where I would just sit and meditate for hours multiple times a week but now I don't feel like I have any way to decompress. I have a service dog I trained myself that is with me all the time and that helps but she isn't happy in the city either. I hope we can move again soon but that upsets my wife. She likes her new job and took it despite my objections. I am trying so hard to get by and support her in her new job but I don't see her much anymore since she works 11 hours a day 5 days a week now on many weeks meaning I only see her around 2 hours a day when she gets home. We have planned vacations but they have been cut short due to her work projects and I fear that other scheduled vacations will face the same. Sorry to complain so much. I should be more grateful for what I have and know a lot of people have it worse off but it is hard sometimes. I am just so tired of living with sever pain 24 hours a day and feel like society doesn't want me in it. The gov is always trying to take away my medicine and I am always being judged by people for not working and being told by social security now that I am not disabled even after all the documentation I have makes me feel like nobody will ever understand what I go through. I don't need any responses, just wanted to type this all out and vent for a minute. If you have to choose between responding to me or someone else who has posted here please choose them over me and I'll understand.

3757,"So guess who just got a breakup Well, just is an understatement. It's been 1 month and 4 days, but, who's counting? He dumped me through text. He was talking to my online fried about me and was asked if he still liked me. So he said, and this is a direct quote, ""used to, but now I'm bi, so I have a different group of people to like."" Five seconds later, a screenshot of their conversation was sent to me by him. I played dumb at first, thinking he meant me to see the ""I'm bi"" part rather than the ""used to like her"" portion. I guess I thought he was too good to tell me he was over me so cruelly. In the end, I gave in and saw what I was meant to see. But by then, my natural reflexes to hide my emotions had kicked in, and I pretended that I didn't give a damn. But I did. And I still do.

To be honest, I can't quite work out how I feel about this. My emotions range from ""we're mature 13-year-old so we can get through this and become stronger together"", to ""I know it's weird to be around him, but you can still be civilised"", to ""go die you fucking bastard who's far too chicken to be worth my time"". Around him, I put on a fake front, smile, laugh, act like I don't care, but inside it hurts to see him happier without me. I guess the fact of life is that I miss him.

I miss his quirky, geeky personality and his obsession with all things medical. I miss how he was tried to fit into the crowd and yet managed to be so entirely unique and special. I miss the way he would do anything to cheer me up, miss his ability to make me laugh in a split second, miss how he would make me feel like the only person in the world who mattered. I miss our long talks, the way I was the first person he approached when faced with any problem and vice-versa. Most of all, I miss the trust we had in each other. He was my best friend. And now barely a proper sentence passes between us each day.

It's been more than a month since I got dumped and I know I'm over him. Yet, I still feel hollow inside, like part of me is missing. My friends tell me he's not worth it, that he's trash and I should move on. But I still defend him because we're friends, right?

I don't know if feeling this way is normal, and I don't know if what I did in terms of hiding my emotions was right. All I know is I want my best friend back, but I want him to be happy. I don't need him to like me or love me, just please, treat me as a friend.

3777,"trapped to live.I go to a big, huge, expensive, and famous school. It's known as one of the biggest party schools in the country. I was so excited to attend when I first decided to enroll here. I thought I was going to turn into the awesome, independent, alive person that I always imagined myself to be. 

Now I'm sitting in my trashed room, bored to tears. I'm so sick of these four walls. I'm so sick of smoking weed and Netflix, (something I never thought I would say). I'm sick of taking walks down the same streets, seeing all the people with their friends and significant others and families. While I'm alone. 

During the last school year I think I might have isolated myself a bit unintentionally. I went through some really hard things, and because I didn't have the energy to go out and party a lot, I stayed home and drew in my room. I drew beautiful pictures of people and fairies and these crazy designs that I was so proud of. 

But after awhile, people stopped inviting me to parties and such, they knew i was going to decline. I don't blame them.
But now it's summer and all my friends that I would at least have interaction with are gone. I have those little suicidal thoughts all the time, but they don't scare me anymore. I guess they don't scare me anymore because I've realized that no matter what I can't kill myself. Because I decided to go to college, I've racked up an enormous amount of debt. My step dad cosigned the loans, so if I croaked, all my precious debt would go to him. I couldn't do that to my parents, they've done too much to help me, they're too good of people to deserve that burden. 

If I would have been a responsible and hard working student, I would have graduated this past May. But instead I'm kinda no where near. I don't like to think about it, but I have so much stress about financial aide and all that stuff.. its terrifying. Especially because I'm spending an incredibly barbaric amount to (maybe) get a degree that (might) get me an okay job worth a bachelors degree in the human services field. It's like I'm kidding myself if I think it's worth it. But I have no choice but to go through with it, because it's my only chance to be successful. I absolutely love my major, it's like it was made for me, but I know it's not going to be enough to conquer my debt.

It's not fair. I feel like I was forced into making huge decisions when I was younger that would decide my whole future, and I'm slowly realizing now that I made all the wrong ones. And because of my bad choosing, I'm now stuck. I can't kill myself. I can't just run away and start a new life. I have to go through this painful, slow process of failing. ",suicide

Things with my hubby and kids are okay and life has just gone back to the same routines, the same things every day. They aren't bad things. They aren't things that trigger my depression feelings. 

So why the fuck am I still feeling this way? WHY AM I STILL HERE? Gah. Sorry guys. I have no clue what is going on. My depression (even with this new medication) has deepened once again. I am not at the point of suicide though. The medication sort of helps me block out those feelings effectively so I don't try to hang myself or slit my wrists open. I don't WANT to go back to the hospital because that would effectively destroy a marriage that is already shaky because of my last attempt. That would send it over the edge and I don't want to go there. I really don't feel the urge to kill myself anyhow (a good thing!) but I can't help thinking that I really wish I HAD died when I overdosed. I wish I had been successful. :(

Good grief. I am pissed off because I can't cut anymore. That would also destroy things. If my hubby or kids saw cuts again (especially this soon after getting out of the hospital) he would leave me in a heartbeat. 

So...what am I left with? Frustration. Sadness. Deep deep depression. Anxiety. 

I can't eat...and I won't eat now. I had gained 5 lbs. in the hospital and now...I am losing all of that and some. I am hungry all the time and I don't give a shit. I like the pain of the hunger anyhow. It is comforting to me. I wish I could lose faster and be 100 lbs. already.

I need to go now. I have rambled on quite enough and I am having a hard time focusing on the screen again.

Sorry to whine here, but I have nowhere else to turn.

His words were "" this is why he will never be a good writer"" as he said it we made eye contact. I was lost for words and in the moment pretended I didn't hear anything.

 I've never had any vision of what I wanted my life to be outside of high school, and I still don't. I don't care about studying or what my major is. To me, life is inherently pointless. You're born, you live, you die. Whatever career you pick doesn't matter, and whatever joy you derive from those you surround yourself with is fleeting. It's like I want to meet and interact with other people but I realize whenever I try that it really doesn't matter. I have nothing of interest to say and I don't really care what anyone else has to say. 

I've just been so bored and apathetic for a long time. I can remember lying in bed when I was like 8 thinking how much better my parent's lives would be if I had never existed.

I've heard all that before and it doesn't mean anything to me. I don't value money, success, material goods, or companionship so the rewards of this world mean nothing to me, and the whole appeal of suicide is its permanence. Saying that killing yourself is something that can't be undone is like telling a sex addict that girls have tits. Kind of counterproductive to what you were going for, I think.

I know self-diagnosis isn't reliable and has a bad reputation, but I've been through so much trauma (growing up and currently living in a severely abusive household, being raped and molested as a kid, being bullied for years, struggling to accept my homosexuality, etc). I've had suicidal thoughts as long as I can remember. I haven't been truly happy in years because I always feel numb and apathetic, and when I do have emotions, I'm drowning in sadness. Even doing small tasks like showering or dressing myself are exhausting and difficult to do.   

I've never been officially diagnosed for depression, and even if I were, there's no possible way for me to be treated for it. My parents don't believe in mental health or mental illnesses and think that therapy and medication is a sham. The other potential sources of help in my life aren't great either. Multiple times in the past, I've tried to tell my doctor that I'm suffering from depression, and she told me that she didn't really think I was. My school's counselor isn't helpful because she doesn't listen to me and would keep telling me that I just needed to be less stressed.   

I have constant breakdowns where I want to harm myself. Most of the time when I have them, they happen for no reason. My most recent one was on Saturday, February 10th. My mother got angry with me and tried to stab me, but I ran away and locked myself in my room. I started crying while laying down on the floor and the breakdown started. I felt like I was having a heart attack and that my systems were shutting down. I could feel myself screaming and convulsing but I couldn't stop. I kept thinking of slitting my wrists (I've never done that form of self-harm though, I'm scared of what would happen if my parents noticed) during it and was so afraid of what my hands might do to myself, and I felt like I didn't have any control over them. At some point, I started slamming my head against the floor and wall because I was in complete agony and I knew it was all in my head and I wanted to make it stop. Usually I have a breakdown approx. once every three months, but I've had three already since 2018 started.

I'm afraid I'm going to kill myself if my depression doesn't get treated soon. I can't wait 2 more years to leave home and get treated then, I don't think it's possible.

He convinced my mom to homeschool me,which she only did once a week until sixth grade. After that nothing. I never had any interactions with anyone else other than them my whole childhood.

When I turned twenty I miraculously passed the GED test and got a drivers license and was kicked out of the house by my stepdad. I was homeless and got a minimum wage jobs and roommates that never worked out, because I had no social skills and still don't. I always had anxiety and depression over my working, education and social skills.
So I broke down and tried suicide, got community mental health and approved for disability and section 8.
I have been living off this for a few years, but still have no friends and can't enjoy anything. Not even movies or music because I see people living full meaningful lives in movies and singing about love in songs.

I'm tired of reading the news and one side is only getting flacked for what they believed in.   
I can't lie when I say I agree with republicans storming the capital hill. American's like those crazy mother fuckers taken a lot of shit from being fucked over and overall 2020 because their private business couldn't stay alive during this bullshit of a quarantine. I don't condone it but no one seems to know if they didn't do it for trump they could have avoided legal action and possibly an Epstine like death in the future.

The worst is when someone who is supposed to be there from your birth and tells you you're worthless and should just do it. You really choose your family.

But I am ending my life. I can't take anymore. I have survived being raped and molested from age 5 to 8 by my step dad. *I am a guy.* I suffered from him beating me daily till I was bleeding. I have suffered from him torturing me and tying me to a tree for days on end no food or water, my mom not caring. him trying to kill me. I have suffered ten years homelessness. never going to school, not learning to read or write until I was 20. now I am 38. I have spent ten years homeless on the streets and have seen many deaths either natural or murders or suicides live right in front of me. I have been shot at, stabbed, had a guy shoot a gun next to my ear while robbing me and causing permanent hearing loss in my left ear. 

I suffer from morbid obesity and can't lose weight from my hormones being out of whack and from genetics being messed up. I have been obese since childhood. no matter what I did, it didn't help or work. 

I have never had family, friends, no one has ever loved or wanted me, even down to my own family. I had to raise myself since I was 5 years old. Had no childhood, never went to school etc. Lost my mom when I was 25, she passed, never knew my real dad till I was 23 then he died a few months later. no siblings no aunts or cousins. I am utterly alone in this world. 

To this day I suffer from PTSD, Severe Social Anxiety, Severe Chronic Depression, OCD, ADHD, Dyslexia, Suicidal Tendencies, I have a very addictive personality, I suffer from Regular Anxiety, Paranoia, Severe Abandonment Issues. And no meds or therapy helps. I have tried for ten years to get it all fixed.

Past eight years I have spent in the dating scene and trying to find a woman to date and settle down with. Past 8 years I have been rejected around 1600 times and told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer a woman or give a woman, mocked at laughed at, told I don't deserve love or a relationship, told I needed to end my life for being so fat and lazy.
 

The other night I had this woman tell me she was interested in talking to me, she loved what she read about me and thought I sounded like a wonderful man. Told me she was fighting alcoholism, was 37, a single mom of 4. living with her parents and jobless. but then she seen my pics and then she said I should be ashamed of myself and I am worse than a drug addict and there is no way she would be with someone as ugly and fat as I am.

Past eight years I have put myself out there and haven't had one date let alone one woman give me a chance. maybe she is right.

Since I was 20 all I wanted to do was find someone who I can eventually settle down with. Be romantic with. who enjoys gaming either it be card games, board games, video games, or just binge watch movies or tv shows. who enjoys the flea markets, parks, lakes, long road trips to nowhere. enjoys slow dancing and snuggling. Someone who is serious and wants to eventually live together and be a real couple. Someone to grow old with and to have a long lasting relationship with.

I would love to find someone to wake up in the morning her in my arms, me sneak out of bed, make breakfast for her. Someone to go to the park, lake or just sit around the house play card/board games or do arts and crafts with and if she had kids we do that stuff as a family. 

To be a family that sits at the dinner eat dinner together. if she has kids then we have family nights every weekend and every other weekend would have family talk night where her kids and her and I could talk and say anything openly without worry or fear of being judged by each other so the kids could have that support at home they would need. 

I would love to have someone to be romantic with and have  nights under the night sky with champagne, candles, roses, and her in my arms. I would love to find someone to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and holidays together. To have that companionship, closeness, togetherness with someone. To be able to just be next to that person and they just look at you and are smiling just because you are right there next to them and you are the reason they are smiling and the reason their eyes are twinkling. 

I get told I am a great guy, an amazing guy, a wonderful man, told any woman would be lucky to have me, then when they find out I am overweight they reject me, ghost me, mock me, bully me, say cruel mean hateful things. maybe they are right though. maybe my weight does make me all those things. and because I can't lose the weight and I can't have the surgery. I will just end it and save this world from having to suffer another day with me in it.

3871,"I don't know what's the point of posting here, but I'll just say everythingThere are too fucking many different problems in this life. First of all, I live in Russia, which is like top 2 suicidal country. I'm 19, I've never had a real friend, never in my entire life. I'm starting to feel like best friends are an illusion, all the people I was friends with were so superficial. I broke up with the only friends I had a year ago. I still think about them, about our memories and the things I've said. And the point is I don't even think that what I said wasn't true, I just shouldn't have said it. 
I felt lonely in their company, which is the worst feeling ever. 

And I've never felt live or lived anyone truly in my entire life either. I have normal parents, but they've always worked a lot. I don't feel their love and I don't really love them back. 

All this led to me finding a way of drawing attention to myself. And the easiest I could find is becoming a femboy, wearing girly clothes for men to fuck me. And even though It does turn me on, when I'm not horny I know that that's not who I am. That's now what I need. 

And among my acquaintances there are no people that I'd like to be my best friend or girlfriend. I just keep rejecting people myself. I can't do anything about it. 

Moreover, I don't have real passion for anything. I have tried many things. I like them, but I realize that I make myself do them. Make myself watch a movie, make myself read a book, make myself play piano. I don't feel anything, I don't want anything, but love, someone to hug, someone, who genuinely would care about me and someone who I WOULD ALSO care about.

Plus there are fucking health problems, like fucked up mind is not enough. I'm 19 and I've had hemorrhoids 3 times, I have a problem with my facial skin, my knees hurt, there are some fucking things in my throat, and I'm gaining fat. 

I know that doing sports is supposed to make your body and mind be healthier, but I just don't see a point. I can't be happy by just running around, I DON'T LOVE ANYTHING OR ANYONE. 

And where do I meet people? Like just go hit on a random girl that might not have a personality I'll like, or that won't like my personality, or even won't find me attractive in the first place. I've said I have skin problem that I can't cure for 6 or more years.

I really don't care. I wish I could believe in god, that would help. But I just don't. So I don't care if I die. Literally the only thing that stops me is my mom. I don't want her to grief. I don't even care about my dad, or brother, or anyone else. I know that I'm going to kill myself eventually. Whether in a year, or when I'll be 90 years old. But I want to do it now.

3886,"My own life has been seeing great progress, but the world ending keeps making me miserable. It's time for me to end.After years of thinking my drawings sucked and I'll never be able to make a living off of them, I've got work at an indie game developer and am seeing commissions for drawings and animations.  After years of browsing Forever Alone, hitting 30 as a virgin, and not having a girlfriend for a decade, I've seen two girls physically attracted to me this year, have chatted for months with a fellow geek on a dating app, and have our first date tomorrow.  After thinking I can't support myself as an independent adult, I've got my own 1-room apartment and am working 2 jobs to successfully live for myself.

After decades of struggling and self-hatred, my life is finally getting better.  But guess what?  Ultimately, it doesn't matter.

My state of mind regarding humanity and life started to break when 9/11 happened in my first month of high school.  I had my eyes truly opened to how violent, hateful, unjust, and painful humanity really was both in the majority of civilization and seemingly at its core.  It took years of therapy to suppress these feelings (My core philosophy/belief of humanity and us all better off dead remained but I stopped dwelling on it), but after the Feguson riots and first rash of recorded racist cop killers hit, something in me snapped again and has consumed me daily from then on.

It doesn't stop.  It doesn't leave me.  If it's not racism it's some other form of suppression.  If it's not Trump it's some other public figure ruining everything forever.  If it's not global warming it's dystopian facism inevitably winning over us all.  I can't escape into media like I used to because they're all becoming increasingly topical.  Every day, either something in the world reminds me of things, or I remind myself when my mind wanders because it's instinctive at this point.  I cry, become numb and immobile, and can barely talk or function for hours at a time while pure despair, fear, sadness, and hopelessness overtake me.  Every day.

I can't sleep because of these.  I can't work as much as I want because of them.  I'm in therapy minimum twice every week and have seen a half-dozen different therapists in the past two years alone.  I've tried dozens of meds and been hospitalized both voluntarily and involuntarily five times.  Nothing works.

I have a large, loving group of family and friends, but they're unable to snap me out of it.  I can no longer value them or my own successes.  I've long hit that realization that myself and them and our lives and dreams are permanently irrelevant now.  The world is perpetually burning into either a miserable existence for almost all or the full-on extinction I so desire.  From now on, nothing we do has any value or importance.  I have nothing to strive for and nothing I can enjoy.

I'm going to let my family and friends enjoy one more Christmas season with me, but come January, I'm going to finally carry out one of my suicide plans I've mapped for years.  I thankfully live in an area where my main two ideas are super easy to pull off and no one can stop me if I don't say my goodbyes until right before I take action.  The letter is written, and I can cross post it to all my social media accounts before finding peace through ceasing to exist.  As an atheist, I believe my consciousness will disappear from all planes of existence, and as long as it means I can never suffer again, it's a sacrifice I don't just accept, but get excited for. Humanity still abides to survival of the fittest just like our original existence in nature.  For all my qualities, the world has made my ability to live non-existent.  It's better that I erase myself.",suicide

3890,"I don't know where else to turnThe past year has been the start of just a fucking shit show to come and I've lost the will and compassion to feel or do much if not anything- I'm only here because I've no idea where else to go. 

Mid 2018 early 2019, me and the girl I was extremely close with loosing touch with one another. We both had feelings but both too anxious to say or do anything about it. After that she got with someone else she barely knew and with little reason, I supported it because I care about her and wanted to support her every decision but it had such a fucking horrible negative backlash on me I spent all my time in year 10/11 locked in a cubicle doing really unhealthy shit. This continues till we leave secondary school and we joined college. She only talks to me when she's drunk or there's no one else to talk to and it fills me with such regret and self hatred I cannot contain it. I still loose sleep over it.
 
Mid 2019 - present day, so much has happened I struggle to compute what's going on anymore. I'm forced to move out of my dads because his mental health condition affects my own, leading to several attempted suicide accounts and more successive frequent relapses of self harm (continuing up until this day). I get very very very close with a guy I love really fucking dearly and he was the only person that would speak to me, he has a boyfriend, we ended up sleeping together a few times (he's allowed it's an open relationship thing I don't know) and I feel completely and utterly belittled by the bf. I don't talk to him but I know that no matter anything I do I'll never be as much to him as his partner or anything else. The guys friends approach me and tell him he's turning into me which changed how I look at absolutely everything with him, he started listening to everything I listen to, he stated self harming again because I did. He became me and it's no one's fault but my own. I wish he never met me, whatever happened it wasn't worth it. We don't talk anymore.

My dad tried to kill himself on Christmas eve. I was waiting at his house for him to come home and he turns up late telling me how he was really low and how he tried to kill himself because of an argument with a friend. He went to an overpass near a Trainline, a bridgelike thing leading onto a very busy road below. He only stopped because a homeless man talked him out of it. It made me cry but I couldn't tell him it upset me because I've never been taught how to show compassion and it made me feel terrible.

Christmas was similar. Insomnia allowed me to sleep at ‚âà6am woke up to 4 children screaming at 7:30am to open their presents. I didn't get anything but I didn't and still don't care about that. I found out my manipulative abusive stepdad was coming to visit so I left and sat outside my dads for a couple hours because he wasn't in and I didn't have my keys. In the end I slept at my dads but ended up SH relapsing after 6 days just around midnight.

The only thing my dad ever bought me, my favourite guitar of all time, was dropped on the concrete path by an old friend of mine and I'm too scared to use him because of the immense disrepair it's in. It's beyond repair and I still have the image of it falling to the ground in my head and it keeps me awake at night.

A few weeks ago a few of my 'friends' (rather people I know) told the college about mine and the guy I'm close with's SH issue. They now think I'm a 'dominatrix instagator' making the guy self harm like me. One of them made a snide remark 'if you're addicted to self harm clap your hands'.

There's more but it hurts bringing stuff up this of the first and last time I'll post here because I just didn't know where else to turn. I promised the guy I wouldn't try and kill myself anymore but at this point I just think why bother. The college I'm at has threatened me with kicking me out because of my mental health so what's stopping me. I always fantasise about going to the woods and ending it but I've nothing to do it with. So here I am. Stuck in emotional purgatory for the millionth time.

She woke up and went to say good-bye to him and he was incoherent. He admitted to taking a bottle of sleeping pills. She called 911. If she hadn't then he would be dead now.

I called the hospital, frantically trying to get information about him and the whole time just thinking ""He's dead. He's dead. They're going to tell me he's dead."" 

Luckily he failed in his attempt. He's stable and being transported to  a psychiatric unit. My mother and grandmother are driving across country (the also live in a completely different state) to see him. 

He had absolutely NO history of depression or mental illness that anyone knew of. He is the most level-headed, intelligent person I know. And I feel like I've just been punched in the gut. In a million years, I would NEVER have thought of him doing something like this. I'm so sad he didn't come to me for help. We've always been close. I'm so angry he put our family through this. I feel so helpless. So I'm just drinking and crying.

3902,"I am going to lose my health insuranceI am a wreck. I have been seeing therapists on and off for years for depression and anxiety. I have screwed up so many times. When I finished High School I tried college and flunked out, lying to my parents about it until the situation dictated that I couldn't keep hiding it. I worked for a few years at terrible retail places and was miserable. I finally was able to go back to school. I love learning, and I'm good at school, but I have trouble focusing sometimes and the last two semesters have been really tough. I'm 25 and my birthday is in a couple weeks. I still live with my parents, who have been notihng but supportive of me. They love me and try to understand and help, but this semester I've had more trouble and I'm flunkin out of a few of my classes like I did before. I don't want to disappoint them, I'm too old to screw up all over again. They don't deserve to have to deal witth this. The biggest problem is that once I turn 26 in a couple weeks my health insurance has to come from school, but that only happens if im full time and right now because of how I screwed up I'm at 3 classes instead of the required 4 for full time. I won't have health insurance to talk to my therapists or continue my medication.

I can't tell my parents about it. They deserve the honesty, but I'm such a horrible person I can't deal with telling them. I want to escape and not have to deal with it anymore, and it is totally selfish of me. They've given me so much and I do nothing but screw up and all I can think about is wanting to escape my own failings, leaving them to feel sad after I am gone. That just makes me feel even worse.

I was doing so well until this semester, but this was my last chance and I blew it.

Among those things were issues I caused within his friendship group due to me ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù and seeing those people as against me. I know I was wrong even though those feelings felt rational at the time but he worries I‚Äôll never get along with them and I don‚Äôt see the point in trying to when they already dislike me. We had a huge argument about it last night because I said I didn‚Äôt regret acting on my feelings...only the fallout which isn‚Äôt true because I regret both but it‚Äôs hard for me to admit i‚Äôm wrong when I feel attacked.. 

The reason this matters is because we both had planned to be with each other again in the future but I feel like now I‚Äôve ruined everything. 

He told me last night I haven‚Äôt changed which hurt because I feel like i‚Äôve been doing so much better and communicating better and not acting on impulse..I just made a mistake last night.

I hate hurting the people I love and I know they will be better off without me because I‚Äôm toxic and manipulative and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever recover. Suicide is almost an act of kindness when it comes to me...it‚Äôs like putting an animal down so it can‚Äôt hurt anyone else.

3910,"Terrified for myself.I'm 24, since I was about 12 or 13 I've absolutely hated my life. I grew up in a dysfunctional household. My parents argued almost every single day. I have an older brother, but we had different dads, he's really distant and he never really took the time to show me the ropes or hang out with me. People always seem to find there way around me, but I've never had an actual close relationships with any of them. Middle school was sickening. High school was torture. Couldn't get into any of the colleges or art schools I wanted to because of my failing grades due to depression and isolation. 

I saw a counselor back when I was 20 who had told me that I've been dealing with major depression for about 9-10 years and that he couldn't help me. He recommended me to get a complete physical and see a psychiatrist to get to the roots of my problems, but at the time my parents argued about it so much that nothing ever came from it.

Now that I'm older with no job, no car, no money, and no healthcare, I can only see a free counselor when I can manage to make it there, and I refuse to go back because she was video recording me and I believe she was showing it to other people even though she claims it was for her college course to become certified it made me incredibly uncomfortable.
She had me on Anti depressants and mood stabilizers. They didn't help and just made me want to sleep all day. I've tried to check myself into a clinic, but since I don't have any money, they just recommended me to a hotline and the same free counselor who I refused to go an see.

I feel as if none of my family cares. If anything they use it to guilt trip one another. That's never really changed, but at this point I feel as if I'm just being kicked around with mental health problems from one person tolerating me to the next. I've been kicked out of 2 different houses since January, soon to be 3 after my grandmother has had enough. No one is hearing what I'm saying and taking it seriously. They all say It's a cry for help and don't treat it as if I'm a threat to myself or others. I'm officially the boy who cried wolf.

I've spent the majority of my life alone, angry, resenting other people. I can't remember a time in my life where I've actually been happy or content other than when I'm alone but it seems to be getting worse and worse. Art has been my only way of coping, but I've lost a lot of passion for it since I've been transitioning into an adult. 

I've tried to kill myself twice before when I was younger, but failed at both attempts. This was back in my teens. I started cutting in Febuary of this year (2016) but (somehow) managed to keep myself from doing that, but since then, a large portion of my day is spent contemplating suicide. I'm tired of the ""it'll get better"" speeches, I'm sick of the ""just change"" talks because I've been hearing them for about a decade now with absolutely no progression and I'm still wanting to die. Recently I even find myself writing suicide notes and deleting them. I'm completely drained of this. It's literally ruined my life and if I have to look forward to another 20 years of this I KNOW I'm not going to make it.

3911,"I've contemplatedso long story short I've had a really shit year and I've contemplated for the first time (21m)). sorry about the long post and weird typing. typed this while emotional mess

long story:

this year started with my father dying and he was my closest friend and confidant and my main person id always go to for help. we like I said, he died this year and being me I internalized it and didn't take it to well, my only help was my girlfriend( now ex but ill get to that). during the whole funeral situation, my family basically had a come apart and my mother wasn't invited, my family on my fathers side just acknowledged it and said shes not wanted here. now my parent were split for 11 years at that point but I did not think it was appropriate and I got into an argument with them about it and it just went to shit at the funeral none the less. well that's the first part

&amp;#x200B;

second was the fact that I lost contact with my intire family. basically my aunt(which caused the funeral ruckus) never contacted me after the funueral and so we lost contact with my dads side including gma(get to that in a minute). on my mother side I lost contact beause of my mother and her being a bitch, I mean at this point our relationship was already strained but the ruckus broke and we had a falling apart which included her intire side of the family. so basically I was left alone with my ex and her family. I couldn't stay in contact with my contact because around may she started really getting demenshia bad and she had time where she wouldn't remember me which broke my heart so I couldn't talk to her anymore without falling apart.

&amp;#x200B;

third: my emotions and goals: it wasn't until recently that I had my shit together. basically I don't really have ambition ions I kind of just drifted which included my emotions, I didn't have any really just I'm there. I'm getting better now but its taken 7 years just to get to this point now. I go from job to job and have no happiness or sadness.

&amp;#x200B;

fourth: my friends: my friends have been shit with one dropping rent on me and two taking shit care of their dogs and me having to look after them (living together) not to mention the friend I have to help me with relationship issues she just dropped me like a brink when I asked for help.

&amp;#x200B;

finally my ex/girlfriend: this was just last month but in reality has been happening for a while. we have been discussing for about a month about moving in and the problems we have so we decided wed work on them together. well obvi that didn't work and now we are broken up, mostly. we plan on attempting to get back together if we can fix the issues that are wrong with both parties and that's fair with me. the only problem is that the we went from talking all the time  to no time. I thought id be fine cause it would be me at the therapist fixing my issues but it gets worse each day and my feeling towards her get stronger and stronger. I got hit by a train were I think of her every night and every day. I'm scared and jealous that she might find a better person in our selected  time. my heart acks all day especially being at home most of the time being I work from home now. we are talking this sat about what needs to be fixed to continue the relationship. I believe that's all so far

&amp;#x200B;

it happened  twice and both were a day apart, I thought of loosing her and never being with her again and just the emotional bubble I have inside me that probably has burst. and nobody to help me through this

On January 2020, I had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and it's taking its toll on me. I couldn't go to therapy because of the coronavirus outbreak. Whenever me and my mother have arguments, I'm always the wrong one. She always keeps herself on top, and I couldn't take things anymore. I just want to die. Prolonging the time before we die is senseless: because we'll all die in the future anyway.

What's the point of living, really? We just get raised by our parents, then what? Compete ourselves with others using our learned skills and knowledge, and compete for the best resources available? Try to gain as much experiences, relationships, achievements, knowledge, and satisfaction, when at the end you'll just die anyway? 

Humans are worthless, selfish pieces of crap. All we ever really did was compete for resources. And they didn't even see global warming as a result of their selfish deeds, competing for resources against the other species of the animal kingdom. Not only that: Humans are well known to compete with other humans too. You have IQ and skills? You climb up the hierarchy. Acquire financial and relationship status. Gain self esteem. You don't have IQ or skills? You stay down the ladder. Live the worst life possible. None to low financial or relationship status. You gain the least esteem. All because of fucking brain and hormonal differences.  

The world is mad. We just stress ourselves out for senseless selfish deeds, when at the end we'll all just die anyway. We are just letting emotional and physical pains, insecurities, anxieties, and fears of death stay on our sides, when at the end we'll all just die anyway. 

Or should I say, we are just prolonging the time left before our final line: death. It's senseless.

3924,"My dad just physically abused me. What should I do? Ok guys, this is a long one, so please bear with me. I am really seeking some helpful information, so it would be great if you could stick through till the end.

It all started when I was lying on my bed, tired after I just finished a long science project. Since I'd sat inside all day, my mum wanted me to go out for a walk. I refused. My mum kept trying to wake me up, nudging me and eventually trying me lift me up off bed. My bed was facing the other side, so I couldn't actually see my mum. I sleepily shook my elbow to try and get her hands off me, but ACCIDENTALLY (notice the emphasis on the word 'accidentally') elbowed her in the nose. She let out a little exclamation but it was nothing serious.

I try to get up and apologise, but, next thing I know, my dad's on top me, pinning me to the bed. I was quite groggy, but nevertheless, sound quite calm when I told my father to take his hands off me. He flat-out said no, asking me why I hit mum. I tried to tell him it was an accident, but kindly told him to take his hands off me first so we could have a proper discussion. Again, he refused (by the way, he's gotten physical with me in the past, and this time I had had enough). I told him multiple more times to take his hand off me, and after even more refusals from his end, I snapped. I started screaming ""HELP ME! AAAAAAARGH!"" and tried to wrestle out of his control. I finally broke free and bolted to the corridor, screaming my lungs out. He followed. - quick little side note: he's my stepdad. not my biological father.

The next few scenes were a bit of a blur. He started physically abusing me, hitting me, and I used my self defence. My mum came out, confused as hell. She starting screaming for dad to stop, and dad pushed her aside. He kept trying to get hold of me, but I kept escaping. Finally, he started just hitting me hard. Although he's weak, I didn't want to hit him back and make the situation even worse. So I simply fell to the floor, tears streaming down my facing, calling for help. I said I would call the police. My mum spread her arms over my body, trying to protect me, but my dad shoved her aside and just didn't let go of me. That was when things got serious. He starting shouting like mad, calling me names and threatening me with some very dark exclamations. He was absolutely furious; I can't even think of a word to describe how angry he was. 

He kept trying to get to me as well as shouting at the top of his voice (verbal abuse). Finally, he let go (I guess he got tired; he isn't that fit). He said that neither he nor my mum would talk to me unless I wrote them both a ""written"" apology. He said I could't go anywhere except for school (btw, I play tennis, guitar, and meet with friends sometimes). He continued with the threatening remarks; one of them I can remember is that if I ever tried to defend myself again, ""he'd bash me to a pulp my tennis racquet"". It was actually a very traumatising experience.

Now, my fellow teens, I ask you this: what next? Do I call the police? One thing I forgot to mention was that when I told him that I would call the police, he wanted me to. He waved the phone in my face, telling me to dial 000 (the Australian police number). Why did he do that? I know that even if I call the police, they won't do anything. Unfortunately, I have zero evidence whatsoever. The only witnesses are my family members, who don't really count in the case of a legal situation. And to top it all off, my dad is a very good liar. Should I just call the kid's helpline instead? Or...? Does anyone have any solutions whatsoever? Why is my dad even like this???? Please answer, I'm really quite emotionally scarred.

3940,"My StoryI've been heavily addicted to drugs (marijuana, opiates, benzos) for the past decade. I quit opiates a year ago and am current 34 days sober from weed. I'm prescribed klonopin because I do suffer from GAD, but I do abuse them.

As a child I was emotionally abused by both my parents. My dad can only understand money and sports. I didn't like sports, nor was I very good at them, but he made me play them all (not exaggerating) which created a cycle of disappointment, humiliation, and emasculation.

My mother has some undiagnosed personality disorder. She spent most of my childhood either crying, having imaginary fights with me when I'd be in an entirely different part of the house, and making me take her medication because she said I was the reason she was so sad.

I got into a good college in 2007, and then the financial crash of 2008 happened. Intellectually unqualified for any field of study with job security, I studied English Lit, got through college smoking myself into isolation and barely crawling out with zero distinction or careee goals. 

Upon graduating, I moved back home. My dad, always one to shove square pegs into round holes, said I had to work for him and got me a job selling insurance in my hometown while everyone I knew fro college moved to Brooklyn or Los Angeles to intern at some prestige bullshit, or stay in the womb of academia and get masters or their ph.d.

It was during this time that my mom decided to become an alcoholic. This was enough, and so I just moved about 5 hours away from my family to temporarily live with my sister who git me a job, but who's, understandably, put some limits on the time I can live with her.

I'm consumed with anger, regret, and isolation. Quitting pot means I'm fighting a long, lonely, mindfuck battle that absolutely nobody gives a fuck about. I've wasted every opportunity I've had and spend my time reading classic literature, playing chess, or watching TV - in other words, still avoiding figuring out how to make something of my life.

I was raised Catholic, left the church, but still remain sympathetic to the concept of Agape. I don't know if many of you read, but I cried for hours over Joyce's Ulysses, which, despite its many difficulties, is simply about thus Love for others despite all of life's injustices.

Well, even with all that, I am consumed by loathing (both for myself and for what's going on in my country right now *guess which country*) 

I feel completely useless and want to leave. Even the genius of a book like Joyce's Ulysses can't persuade me to stick around. My mother has begun sending me drunk texts filled with misspelt apologies, but I've finally blocked them. My dad and I have an OK relationship, but it's still one defined by tragic misunderstanding, and with years of recovery from drug abuse ahead of me, it just seems like too much. I don't foresee marriage. I don't foresee career fulfillment.

Well that's my story. I don't want to pay for a therapist, so I needed to scream into a void somewhere. If you've read this far, thank you.",suicide

3944,"my friend hanged himself Hello Reddit

Yesterday I received a message from someone claiming to be the brother (let's call him Daniel) of an old friend of mine (and call him Robert). He messaged me using Robert's discord account so I had no clue if it really was his brother. Daniel started asking me questions about me and the relationship I had with Robert. We were only friends and nothing more. We haven't talked in a year because last time we did, we had a pretty big fight since he couldn't accept the fact that I found myself a boyfriend. Robert was drunk and never talked to me ever again. Long story short, Daniel ended up telling me Robert hanged himself in his appartment last year, but was found two weeks ago. Now this is where things start to be weird, because if a body is hanging and left alone for a year at room temperature, he should be in an advanced decomposition state. Anyway, Daniel also told me about a letter Robert wrote for me and now I'm waiting for him to send it.

The thing is, I'm not sure I can believe Daniel. I knew Robert had a thing for me, but he never told me about having a brother, I think he is lying but isn't faking a suicide a bit over the top ? In the messages I received, there were many incoherent things. For example, Daniel asked me if I was Robert's ex-girlfriend, but only asked me later if I was a boy or a girl. If Robert was dead last year, wouldn't his neighbors start smelling the corpse ? Wouldn't his employer phone him ? Wouldn't his dog bark at his owner ? I tried calling him on his phone and it rang, which means it's not out of service. I'm asking myself so many questions and I'm not sure what to do, this is a very weird situation I never had to deal with before.

TL;DR:A friend of mine was found dead and his brother, that I wasn't aware he had, wants to send me a letter, but I can't trust him.",suicide

3948,"I hate myself and feel that I deserve to feel this way and don't deserve to live(Context: 21 male living at home while commuting to college and work while trying to manage depression and anxiety problems) I don't understand it. It's so hard to be nice to myself. But if I knew someone else like me and about my situation I would want to do anything I could to be nice to them. But I don't like myself and think I deserve this. I think it might be due to my personal traumas. I'm a triplet and my siblings never wanted to play with me when I was younger and got more attention than me because they would through fits but I learned to be quiet and that the only way to get positive attention would be to be perfect and quiet. I would still get in trouble sometimes for making mistakes and a lot because if any of us got in trouble my dad would punish all of us so I never knew when I would get in trouble for something. My parents would get in arguments if my mom bought us toys and for other reasons that I'm not aware of but I would hear them fighting and would hide and cry by myself. Then they got divorced when I was in the 6th grade and that didn't end until I was in 8th grade. It was a bad divorce and I remember my aunt saying she wanted to strangle my mom to my mom while I was there. I wasn't allowed to tell my dad anything about her house because then we were told we wouldn't get to see our mom again. She also was trying to turn us against him and she understood my depression when I was a child although I never got help until later. She liked me so I believed her about my dad. But she also became an alcoholic and I had to pay for dinner sometimes with my christmas and birthday money and had to drive her home one time about an hour alone when I was 15 because she brought wine with her and passed out. We were there with my stepdad and siblings but we took two cars and I was the one who stepped up. Then I told our stepdad that I wanted her to start drinking less because she always got mad and then passed out on the couch and he told her that and she kicked him out. Then she got worse and My brother and I chose to move out and move in with our dad full time instead of 50/50. This was when I was 16 and she died while I was 17 two weeks before senior year of high school. I think she might have killed herself because no one will tell me how she died and I found out years later that she was bipolar. I had been treated for depression when I was a junior but I wasn't allowed medication because of my dad saying no. Her death didn't really hit me until college and when it did my depression worsened and I became suicidal for the first time. I found help at my colleges counseling center and began to realize a lot was wrong. I thought everything that happened to me was normal because thats how my family looks at it they pretend nothing ever happened and that everything is good. At this point I was 18 and had to drop some classes because I wasn't functioning properly and was going to fail the classes. My dad found out and burst into my room while I was sleeping and yelled at me and questioned me for about a half hour and then he ignored me for about 6 months. My Aunt made me talk to him and he blamed me for everything wrong with me. Around this time I tried to kill myself after he had me clean his girlfriends car and I was crying because I was out of energy because of my depression and then had to clean her car and he saw me crying but left anyway and I had done my research and knew it would take about 12 minutes in the garage with the engine on but I only made it to 7 before chickening out and I cried in my room until passing out. Shortly after I had to change therapists and was barely holding everything together with work and a partial class load and the school racing team I was on. I felt terrible around my family so I was only home for about 4 hours a night which eventually broke me. My dad still was mostly ignoring me and refused to get brakes for my car because ""money was tight"" even though he said he would pay for a car and maintain it but wouldn't pay for tuition. He was going on trips with his girlfriend though. I had some close calls with the car and knew he didn't care about my safety as much as he did money. Then my sophomore year of college I finally got medication after working through that with my therapist and I discovered that my something wasn't right with my dad and family. I learned that he is probably an undiagnosed narcissist and I set down the road of trying to accept it and the fact that he would never be a real parent to me. Which has been very hard and I still sometimes think it must be something I've done and that I'm not good enough to be liked or loved and that I'm a bad person who doesn't deserve love, kindness or happiness. That I don't deserve to live and that I should just give into the pain inside because I'll never deserve to be happy and that no one will ever really love me but that it's all a trick to manipulate me into doing what they want. I just feel like poison inside and my world has turned upside down and I don't know what to believe anymore and I feel so damaged and broken beyond repair that there's no point because even when I think I deserve better I'll probably never heal enough and I'll feel like this forever. My Aunt also recently told me that no one will be nice to me or like me because I'm too quiet and negative and that they won't until I go back to being the happy kid. Sorry I know it's probably too depressing and not that bad in real life but worse in my head.

I just feel like random ""depressive attacks"" (idk if that even exists) passes through me from time to time, I'm currently in one of those ‚Äîand the strongest I've ever had... I've never had the intense necessity to self-harm, but now I... I just feel like ripping my veins out‚Äî. 
Well, you be probably thinking why do I feel like that... Thing is I don't even know... I mean, I have such severe things going on, but they've been there for quite a long period of time, and never lead to anything close to this.

They rejected me from both my dream careers (Neuroscience and Genomics ‚Äîbut still accepted in other 3‚Äî) like 2 weeks ago, but i don't think that's the problem, or at least not the whole.
Those attacks I said usually are coined together with flashbacks ‚Äîlong history‚Äî, shortened version: I think I was raped around 5-7yro and I had amnesia (those flashbacks came to my mind since idk when, but long ago, but I instantly forgot about it like next day... Until 1 year ago when suddenly I got conscious about having a mental gap [however I still can't remember anything about what happened, I just know something happened].

So, the other thing is being trans... I just accepted it during this quarantine, and no close-relative knows. I'm quite anxious about it (back in time, I thought trans ppl exaggerated dysphoria, now I see it's fucking completely real), whatever, I don't thing that's what's affecting me this much rn neither.

Idk if I just had panick attacks the whole night or what, but my hands' sweating, I got random crying attacks, hyperventilation, my hearth goes crazy, and I can't fucking sleep (as a matter of fact, can't since like 1 week ago).

I tried to ask for help to my friends, but I feel like I'm bothering 'em. I first had this today around 12 in the night, and a girl started chatting with me out of nothing, so that tranquilized me for a while, but then another attack came 30 mins later and went off, but then another one came, and one more like 20 mins ago (I'm at 3:50 in the morning).",suicide

Well, I'm still alive. My brother found me while I was bleeding out and I've spent the past 2 weeks in inpatient. I got my mess sorted out and I'm feeling a lot better. I've decided to focus on myself for a while, I got a gym membership and a haircut...i cut up my face pretty bad and needed over 70 stitches including my wrists. People look at me a lot now, so that's something to get used to I suppose. I still have an urge to self harm, but I'm hoping I can push through. Thank you all for your comments. 
******************************



My life has taken many turns up until now. Not the worst you've seen on this sub. Sexual abuse dominated almost my entire high school life. I was afraid of sleep, as hyper realistic nightmares filled my sleep. I was threatened daily with torture and rape. I developed insomnia, depression, and psychosis. I was threatened with being kicked onto the streets if I didn't do whatever he asked of me. Once I got away from him, I was fine for a while. I was still depressed most of the time, but now I had little fits of manic energy, so I brushed it off. I graduated high school thinking it was all over. But then the dreams came back. My psychosis caused me to self harm daily, and I also developed an eating disorder. I attempted suicide for the first time this February. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. I went to the psych ward multiple times after this, and in May, I attempted again. 

I've tried recovery, I really have. I wanted so desperately to be better, to be happy. But some people can never reach happiness. Some people just keep going down. I am all alone. All my friends have abandoned me, I'm just a drag to them, even my friend that I went too for everything told me they couldn't help me anymore. I have no one left to talk to. I have only one friend who will still talk to me, but I can tell I'm being a burden. No one can understand. In the end, everyone always leaves me. I won't go back to the psych ward. I'd rather be dead. Last time I went I was treated like a prisoner, had my rights taken away. I got even worse because of being there. 

I feel so alone. All around me are smiling faces, telling me I can recover. But they don't know that. They can't possibly understand. I'm done. I've put on my favourite movie, got my razor out...its showtime",suicide

3974,"‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt owe anybody success‚Äù
In America (and elsewhere I‚Äôm sure), the ferocity of competition is incredibly damaging to the soul. We blame ourselves for not becoming rockstars or billionaires because we‚Äôre told ‚Äúanyone can do it!‚Äù and it‚Äôs horribly untrue and destructive. 
Capitalism has done great things, but at the expense of our humanity. So motherFUCK anybody who passes judgement on you for not becoming what they think success looks like. 

On this sub I see heart-wrenching stories of absolute terror...horrors that are so foreign to me. But also some that are not, such as the feeling of utter insignificance. There are well-hidden realms of hell in this world that masquerade as innocuous and even pleasant and so when we start tearing ourselves down despite no true wrongdoing (murder, rape)...we would be wise to realize that it is only a product of our brainwashing, and that we are perfect exactly where we are. This isn‚Äôt hippie-talk...this is the truth. 

Of course, working to better your surroundings is a totally cool goal...but don‚Äôt attach your self-worth to it. You are not worth only what you can produce. Your life is immensely valuable all on its own. Think back to when you were a kid. Were you upset because you weren‚Äôt a prodigy like Mozart? So then why do we set such high standards as we age?

3980,"A LESSON IN FINANCES As a teenager, my parents took the liberty of teaching me the best way to go about finances. While you all are still young, this is the perfect time to start working on finances and becoming successful in the future.

Lesson 1: Relationships
Relationships are key in finances. If your future spouse doesn‚Äôt agree with how you want to live, it may be time to consider someone else. Most divorces happen because of finances, and people who don‚Äôt agree, and if you don‚Äôt agree with your spouse and end up in a divorce, they automatically get 50% of the money you have, and if you‚Äôre a male, you have to pay child support and you won‚Äôt be able to live how you want, because you won‚Äôt have money. Now, sometimes, you can compromise with your girlfriend, but make sure it happens before marriage. That‚Äôs the cutoff that you have.

Lesson 2: Investing
A lot of you will be starting your jobs real soon here. Talk to your parents about starting a stocks account for you. Investing is an amazing way to earn money for the future. If you want to learn a bit more about this, there are all kinds of Youtubers and YouTube videos that explain it all. This is one of the best ways to get money and set yourself up for the future and paying for those things you want. I have met too many people who didn‚Äôt learn about this until their 30‚Äôs and 40‚Äôs and they regretted it very deeply. Invest in the stocks, remember, this is the time to buy while everything is down from COVID-19.

Lesson 3: Student Loans
DO NOT GET STUDENT LOANS!!! Student loans are a HORRIBLE idea. They seem great at first, but you become a slave to them if you don‚Äôt pay them off immediately. The longer you wait, the more expensive they are, and the worse life will be for you. Do not get student loans. One way to avoid that is investing like I said earlier. Make sure to set aside money to invest and you will be able to pay for schooling in the future.

Lesson 4: Your future life
In the future after college, make sure to set aside some money for investments. The best way to go about this is saving $150 a month for your investment purposes, and put it into your stocks account. At first, it may be hard, but it will set you up for life, and by doing this, you can become a successful person.

Lesson 5: School
Make sure to do well in school. Doing well in school is one of the key components in being successful. You don‚Äôt even have to do super good, just try to avoid C‚Äôs, and 100% avoid D‚Äôs and F‚Äôs. If you can do this, future you will be thanking yourself for the work and determination you put into how you wanted to live later in life.

Lesson 6: Personal items
Sometimes, you will want to buy something nice for yourself, like a nice piece of tech or something. Do not do this. In a few years, it will be outdated and it won‚Äôt be very good anyways, so why get a new one now? Use the money you WOULD use to get that device or electronic, and invest it! A lot of the stuff I am telling you will mostly revolve around investing in the stock market, and trust me, you will be grateful in the future that you were able to learn this stuff.

Just remember, this is something that most people would regret not learning, and if you can discipline yourself now, you will be setting yourself up to be successful in the future, and you can get the things you enjoy to have. You will be able to get those cars you want, you will be able to get that nice computer, and keep updating it. Just follow these steps, and you can almost guarantee that you will be able to retire and live well.",non-suicide

I feel trapped. 
I've no options if I fail this degree, nothing to live for. 
I always knew it'd end up like this. Never had the guts in the past, but now I have no choice. 

I know suicide doesn't fix anything but it does provide a conclusive stopping point. I don't think there's anything else out there, I don't think it'll be magical or special. Like everything in this life it was a lie, a big sham. 

I'm going to be stood in the woods at a nice-ish spot I know, it'll be windy, I'll be cold and I'll be shitting myself. I'll be sad, I'll be crying I'll be wishing there was a way out and knowing there isn't. 

Every time I've not let go it's hurt more and more to stay. 
I see no future, can't envisage a future where I'm alive. 

There's just no better option, and this way it'll at the very least all stop. 
the last few times I was so close. But I always get caught up in making notes. 
I'll be making them the next few days and then mailing them to a friend, so they get to him after I'm gone. 

Then it'll just be me, the wind, the rain, the mud and the edge. 

I always made the mistake of fetishising the way I go - it had to be perfect, to be a profound escape, life isn't profound, like it's rosy, life isn't good. Why would death be. We're born into shit, we live through shit and then we die of shit. 

It's going to be scary, lonely and cold, but that will all end, and so will everything else once I'm gone. 

I fucking hate my family, my friends will be fine, my sister will be fine. 

It'll hurt my parents - who gives a fuck. Fuckers ground me down, drove me into the shit and made me wish I was dead for as long as I can remember. My prick of a dad choked me out the other day, thought it'd stop by the time I was 22 but guess not. 

It'll hurt my friends - they'll understand. Eventually it dulls and fades and you get used to it, I know from experience. 

It'll hurt my sister. That's going to suck, sure. she'll never get over it, sure. Am I really supposed to stay living in purgatory just so she can have an okay life? Fuck that, losing me won't be that much of a detriment. 
She'll find a bf or gf, get married, have kids and die like the rest of us. She'll have to deal with me being gone, sure.

All my life I have been trained to focus on making good grades so I could go to college and get a job. I did well at that. I've got a full time job with benefits and I'm out on my own. And that's it. I feel like I've fulfilled all I've ever known as my purpose in life and everything seems completely pointless. To boot, I'm new in town and 90% of my friends live 3+ hours away. The ones that do live nearby flake out on hanging out almost every single time. One of my best friends said she'd try to move here after she graduates but it's apparent that's not going to happen. My long distance boyfriend promised the same but I seriously doubt that will happen either. And if we can't figure out a way to be together, he's already told me that'll be the end of it.  

So, I really don't have anything to look forward to. I've got no real goals to strive for, and even if I did, I barely have the energy to clean the apartment and make food for myself. I tried to confide in a friend last night but all he said was ""stop whining and do something you like""...

My kids have to deal with me being absent mentally and barely functional because of whats happening... And a long history of C-PTSD and depression on my end.

I didn't want kids, not when I had them. I knew it was too soon...

But I didn't have the courage to abort. (Hyper religious upbringing). Not til way later, twice, after any inkling of religion was pounded out of me.

You can only deal with what I have for so long before God either becomes an enemy, or a sad fairy tale told to the foolish and naive.

And I would think that it was temporary... Except this has gone on in some form my entire life. It's unspeakable. I will never, never get justice for what has been done... I can barely speak about it in even the most general terms.

4011,"If you're bored and are looking for a light read, check out this book I wrote when I was younger! Hi everyone! When I was younger (think preteen age), one of my hobbies was writing books based on what was going on in my life. Recently, I've been inspired to look back at my old writing for some reason. It's definitely not worthy of publishing, but I am curious whether it would have appealed to you when you were around the age of the protagonist (10-12). Some things I wrote in this book are extremely unrealistic while others are quite plausible even looking back at it years after I wrote it, which makes me curious how it would be received by others.

Here is a synopsis of my book: *Ten-year-old Margaret Lorie is your typical preteen girl in many ways. She's learning to navigate the transition between being a child and a young adult, which naturally involves many changes. The story opens as Meg must cope with a new addition to the family via the adoption of a little girl named Wayne. Join Meg's ups and downs as she navigates the unpredictable world of middle school friendships. You'll meet nice and mean girls during the journey, but beware - most girls around this age can be both! And, of course, as the title would suggest, Meg develops a crush on a boy named Max who is actually fourteen years old. How will their friendship develop over the course of the story and influence Meg and the world around her?* [Read Max and I to find out](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9QXF08iQtf31iGRPq29mFz51ccMdfbJWib7sXf0Tko/edit?usp=sharing)*.*",non-suicide

I didn't hit a visible(big) vein and it doesn't hurt as much as I want it to but I am really scared. I think I might break down tmr imploring my mom to not let me go to the swimming pool. I am short and going to the swimming pool is my mom's first priority.  I put some paper under my watch over the cur and really tightened it. Please give me a suggestion on how to convince my mom to not get me to the swimming pool. Should I cut myself in a place other than my wrist(like cut my pinky finger off or some shit) and show my mom? It doesn't hurt, I do shit like this daily and I even inject growth hormones in my thigh. Cutting doesn't hurt me

Edit: It's like skin deep. I can see what's under the skin pretty clearly but I didn't cut under the skin. LIke I can still move my fingers and shit, it's like a thin yellow-clear skin under here.

In addition, a recent breakup has been almost traumatic for me‚ÄîI cry every single day when I think about it. It‚Äôs been three months, and I still cry every day. 

I also start grad school on Monday, and have been feeling impostor syndrome. I feel like I‚Äôm unqualified to be in that position. 

My 3 roommates also had an intervention with me because they‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been acting strangely and lashing out. I‚Äôve noticed it too, so I‚Äôve been isolating myself to avoid complications. However, they have taken my social withdrawal as an offense. During the intervention, I told them my problems (notes above) and they still seemed to invalidate what I felt. 

I‚Äôm not sure what else I have to look forward to for the future. I have been depressed for more than half of my life now.  When the crisis counselor asked me what my ‚Äòbaseline‚Äô was, I couldn‚Äôt tell him because I‚Äôve been depressed for so long.

Well me being born into this religion I didnt have much of a choice when it comes to being apart of it.
 So I plan to leave it when I'm old enough to go and live out on my own. But I dont want to be lonely, I would never be able to talk to my family ever again practically. And if they were to try and reach out to me then they could get in trouble to. So I have 3 choices with my life. 
1, either I stay and just suffer my whole life having to deal with this religion until my parents were to die. 
2, leave the religion and my family as soon as I can have my own living arrangements and a steady job setup and have to put up with never being able to tall to my family ever again.
3, just killing myself would be the easiest way out. I've already done so many stupid things throughout my life and my parents can already tell I'm not doing that good in this religion. So if I were to end it all I wouldnt have to deal with either being with any family at all or dealing with this religion still.

4042,"Warning: Suicide (Nobody will read this)My name is William and I am 23 years old. I have a mental illness. I suffer from depression, I have anxiety and I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. What lead to me to this point of suicide is loliness overall. I see and feel the loliness I suffer everyday. I have no support system and have been battling it all on my own through restless nights and empty days. I attempt to go out in public and can see that people don't wanna be near me. They look at me like I'm some kind of animal. That's why I have this alternative to take the time and tell you my story here online. The things I feel to some might be confusing and disturbing to some people which is understandable. Some people say they may care about me when I feel the exact opposite and they more, or less resent me more than anything. I have had experiences where I have voluntarily admitted myself for psychiatric help and got nothing out of it, but the mistreatment of the staff. I have called the National Suicide Prevention lifeline services and was told on numerous occasions believe or not to ""hang up"" because I was only emotionally distraught instead of being actively suicidal in that moment with only the thoughts of suicide building through my mind before and after those experiences. Between my past traumatic history and current life has left me depressed with the thoughts of unworthiness, uselessness, unwilling, and now suicidal. I get angry, sad and cry to myself, and  then the feelings repeat itself in a vicious cycle. I feel the urge to self harm a lot and use weapons and leverage on myself to put myself in complete danger. When I'm around good people that want to help and for example I get a negative attitude because I'm going through so much and feel overwhelmed. I tend to violently snap and perform violent activities on myself and possibly others if physically someone was around which I know I'm more than capable of hurting and possibly killing someone. I've been exposed to a lot of fucked up shit. I couldn't handle it alone and till this day I feel alone even though someone out there might be experiencing pain of their own, but as a victim to society, as a vicitim of my own I don't see that because I'm caught up in my own problems and imprisoned by my mind. I am not a very socialized individual and my actions speak for me. As I said I don't have the support and I have no family, or friends. Unfortunately I've had more bad luck than good where people don't want to acknowledge my existence as a human being first and look at me and even mistreat me like a cancer to society. At 23 years of age I've pretty much experienced it all since the beginning of my childhood. I'm not gonna write about all my past traumatic experiences only for the simple fact is I'm feeling anxious at this very moment. I've been through the heart aches, I've been apart of violence and devolped an explosive and destructive temper because of it and violent tendencies whenever I feel lonely and sad. At least I acknowledge I have been through enough where you would think some kinda high ups or ""anarchy"" is watching me to know enough I've been through enough and paid it with my heart and soul.  Moments where I was in life threatening situations to being in what is known as a life threatening situation, but by my own device. I have health issues. I've had injuries caused by certain events that transpired in my youth. I'll give you an example: Whenever I get anxious like I have been, and my anxiety shoots up, I get like a shock wave in my legs, my jaw sometimes feels wired shut, my arms start to shake, or sometimes if it gets really bad, I throw up and cough up blood in my lungs. As far as those restless nights? I go to sleep for the most part with something always on my mind that's occurimg. It's most likely a flashback of a traumatic event I went through and I toss and turn and wake up all alone with cold sweats and I sometimes scream and breathe heavy. Normally I would use Reddit as my last cry for help, but in my experience between the real world and online as far as getting and receiving emotional support had been a bust. I have had more assholes and judgmental people if anything. I think it's because people just don't want to deal with the burden of me.

In November I quit my delivery job, I wrecked two cars, and couldn't handle the stress and anxiety of working inside a pizza store. My mood has progressively gotten worse. I thought I would be able to buy a car with my tax return, I worked 5 jobs last year, I made close to 8k. I got my hopes too high. I'm not even getting enough to cover tuition for one class at the community college.

I've always been depressed, since I was maybe 6 or 7. I've been on and off of meds my whole life. I'm 21 now. I was expelled from high school my freshman year for buying drugs and trying to kill myself during school hours. I had a kid when I was 17 because the boy I was dating raped and abused me, I couldn't abort, because I genuinely thought if he didn't kill me himswlf, he would find someone else to do it. He went to prison for trying to bomb his school. I failed my first semester of college, because I couldn't keep up with the class work and having a new born. I tried to get a job, but I couldn't keep one, either juggling child care and job hours or the anxiety of interacting with other people. Then I tried to go to college again last year, and another abusive person I was dating kept me from going to my classes. He told me I wasn't allowed to be there while he was there, and so I dropped out. A friend helped me get my delivery job, things were ok for a month or two, and my boss at that job, started being more blatantly abusive to the workers, singling me and a few others out. I freaked out and tried to jump off a bridge the hospital stay put me 6k in debt. In total, I've been hospitalized 6 times, and I've tried to kill myself over 10.

I have terrible crippling social anxiety I can't go anywhere I almost broke down last week because I had to go buy some fucking food.

I'm so tired of being told to ""hang in there!"" If you took one step into my disgusting mind you would be begging to get out, I have suicidal homicidal and compulsive tendencies I'm pretty sure I've been hallucinating for about a year now and I go into dissociative type moods where it feels like someone else is in my mind.

I'm on my 3rd shitty therapist who is going no better then the last ""have you tried grounding? Here I'll teach you some techniques"" I want to kill you.

To whoever reads this go ahead leave your petty small comment telling me it's worth it I don't care no one can convince me your words are mere raindrops to be wiped away in my mind.

I guess I came here because I don't want to feel lonely I've had vivid inescapable daydreams of my family hanging themselves as I kill myself over and over and over again get out of my head.

This isn't normal I'm not normal maybe I should give in maybe I should just crumble under my compulsive mind that rewards me for shameful actions. I'm a gross disgusting being no one knows I'm like this, in fact no one is close to me I can't stand social interaction from the way people piss me off to my intrusive thoughts I'm losing the battle to spurring to being on the verge of a panic attack because social interaction is too much.

I can never say what I want to, I told my closest friend to kill themself, told my father I would rip his throat out in his sleep, I told my mother she is better off dead because she is a cripple, I look like barbed wire was grinded down my legs because I constantly cut while in some form of mania, I'm so lost I don't even shower or brush my teeth and only eat when the pain gets to me, I've lost about 20 pounds at a rapid pace, I used to masterbait all the time but that brings me nothing now I simply sit in bed even writing this has me exhausted, and I swear to god if my teacher assigns one more assignment I'm going to write a code to send him a picture of my dead body with a note that says ""you did it""

I've tried to practice religion but it didn't work for me, the way I see it people latch to religion for selfish reasons, they either tell themselves that there is an afterlife and reinforce the idea with thousands of others, or use it to overcome addiction maybe they were born into it?

My parents are constantly screaming at each other as I fall deeper into a state of delusions, MY MIND IS BUILDING IT'S OWN WORLD I am constantly in a state of hearing or seeing things and sometimes I hear people say things they didn't such case with my parents my mother asked me to get out of bed apparently but I heard vivid and clear ""your almost 18 get ahold of yourself""

4098,"I think I might try to overdose again...Last month I tried ODing on my meds, but didn't have nearly enough left and just ended up getting high. I'll finally be able to get refills on the 12th, and I'm thinking about attempting it again, possibly adding alcohol this time if I can get my hands on some to ensure I don't survive.

I'm just tired of being a fuck up, a burden, a disappointment, a failure, a worthless mentally ill piece of shit who just pushes people away. I recently pushed away the girl of my dreams, who I loved (and still love) more than anything in this world. I wish I had been a better boyfriend, I wish I hadn't been so codependent, impatient, negative. She just wanted me to be her happy escape from all of the bs in her life, and I failed her.

I'm really considering attempting suicide again once I get my refills. I hate this endless cycle of me opening up and getting closer to people and just becoming a burden and pushing them away eventually. I loved my girl more than life itself, I cared about her more than I've ever cared about anyone or anything, and now she won't even talk to me... and it's all my fault. She gave me plenty of chances, and I just kept making the same mistakes. 

I'm tired of being alone. I spent more than my fair share of time alone and miserable before I met her, and it hurts so much more now because I had my dream girl and of course I fucked it up in spectacular fashion... I don't want to be alone again, and I just seem to push away any friends I manage to make or anyone I get close to. I'm tired of this endless cycle... and to top it all off, pretty much everything about me is pathetic. I'm 20 years old with pretty much no life, and little to no life skills. Hell, I'm still trying to figure out what my ex even saw in me in the first place.

I'm almost done with this awful STEM degree that will open up so many doors to me, and that should excite me, to see some change. To be able to walk around on my own feet and see things I've never seen, to be able to give back to all of those who I owe everything.

Instead the only thing I feel is ennui. I don't care about software. I used to have passion. It's all gone. I have nothing to look forward to. I can't even bring myself to fake a little enthusiasm when my parents call to check on me.

I still don't have a plan, but sometimes I think about how miserable and average I am and can't keep from crying. To be released from all of this would be so nice. It just doesn't feel like I'll ever be happy again. I just want to send out a final message thanking everyone and go to sleep for the last time.

It's supposed to get better... but it isn't. I'm still waiting. Something will happen now and then that seems like it will lead to happiness, but thus far it's all been nothing but frigid disappointment. To protect myself from more hurt, I find myself assuming that it will be.

I had to email my geology professor last night because this week I started having trouble finding all my assignments. This morning she emails me back saying that the reason I don't have my stuff is cuz I didn't do an exam that was due *last Sunday the 13th.*

Every single day I click through my classes, every single tab, to make sure that I'm not missing anything. I'm all caught up on my stuff, I check my grades, everything is fine, except I feel like I'm not doing enough work this week for geology.

I just wanted someone to know my story.
Since the suicide note I left my family is far more simple.
it's more like ""soz lads, seya lata dnt 4get ur toilet papur"".(kappa)
On Wednesday the 06/07/2016 at around 9pm I will be dead, this time I'm jumping off a cliff so it's pretty ensured. (DO A FLIP!)
By the pictures it looks like it has a beautiful view.

So I am a 21 year old female from Australia. 
I'm not pretty or smart, I have no talents nor am I a good person. 
I loved League of Legends, Overwatch, Halo and The Ocarina of the time is the best Zelda game.
I'm a fucking loser who enjoys listening to shitty music and pretending I'm ""one of the boys"".
Even though everyone fucking knows I'm not and I'll never be on their level.

My reason for finally ending it this time is that I'm too broken to fix. {Insert emo ass music here pft}
When I was about 10 I tried to jump off a balcony knowing that I would die and it'd fix all my problems. I did this because I was tired of being sexually abused, mentally abused and physically abused. I'm in some child porno somewhere on the internet so that shit lasts forever. By physically abused I don't mean ""omg my mem hit me for throwing my iphone at someone"" I literally mean that my step mother would beat the fuck out of me then bash me even more smashing my head against windows because I would bleed, I still remember the feeling of grabbing the steel grid under my bed and pulling my body so just I wouldnt get beat again for being alive. I don't blame my step mother for her cuntish behaviour, after all she was a kid (like 19) herself when she came to a new country just to have 3 kids shoved in her face, she was probably raised the same way.

My second attempt was when I was around 14 or 15. My mother moved to America with her new Husband and my father had his new family, so my brother sister and I had no place to go. We moved into an apartment, run only by us children. My brother was a total fucking cunt at that age, and with no parental supervision or guidance all of us were fucked. I probably only went to school a few times that year. I don't know what stopped me from jumping in front of those train tracks, but I ended up at a friends house and they treated me like family it hurt so much. I was probably using them. I didn't expect people noticed I went missing and after my cousin told me that I was a missing person I told him where I was, after all I'm not a real cause for drama and the police losing time over.

My Third attempt was when I was 18 I tried to swallow a bottle of pills, I had just lost my job in America, a country where I only went to protect my mother who was being abused by some low life fuck only to get kicked out as soon as I turnt 18. I lived in the ghetto. I earned 8.75 an hour for a high stress job, I worked 6 days a week worked from 5am to 7pm with an hour break, I ate mc donalds every fucking day because I had no time. And worst of all I dropped out of university, which I wouldve graduated soon. That is what broke me the most. I always had a plan, I'm going to get into the art industry, go to uni, finish when I was 18 and move to Japan to live in some small shitty apartment in Ikebukuro, and that wouldn't matter because I'd be happy anyway. My body ended up rejecting the amount of pills I had taken and all I did was throw up, pretty picture. That's the closest I came to dying, it was kinda weird, I wasn't attached to my body at all or at least it felt like it. It was almost like I was watching myself die, until I threw up that it. I ended up reaching out to my mum, she said I could move back in with her, only to be told a few days later to go kill myself. That's when I wanted to try again and told my sister goodbye this time, but she told me to come back to Australia and wasted all her money on a plane ticket for my useless ass. I'll never forget that.

I never got to get to my fourth attempt, I had moved in my a friend and her cute family who I was also probably using being the shit I am. They sent me to hospital. I never want to go back.

My dad is back in my life and he is trying, and I love him so much but it sucks knowing that you're wasting peoples times constantly. It feels so bad. I feel so sorry for him. My mother hates me and I don't blame her she wasted money on bringing me up only to be some fucking useless twat. 
My sister is nice but she'd be better off without me and my brother hates me it's pretty obvious, I also don't blame him.

Okay so logically, emotions aside I feel like suicide is beneficial to my society.
(I'm pretty sure playing video games all day isn't helping anyone other than myself.)
I can't work, properly socialise or preform any activities that help others.

With out my life: Government doesn't have to pay for me to live, friends don't have to bother with suspecting that I don't like them because I'm bad at communicating and family doesn't have to give a single fuck about a lost cause anymore.

I have a home, I have food, I have a bed, I have internet, I have electricity, I have opportunity for education but what I don't have is the fucking logic to appreciate any of it and stop being a little bitch.

Hence why I, just another fucking dead loser have justified my suicide! 
I don't have anyone to tell this to so I guess I'll just leave it here for you to laugh at.

Regardless;
I wish you all the best in life, and I hope you can be happy.
I know that there are a bunch of you out there who can actually make it and not pussy out of life like me.

4134,"Just need to get things off of my mind and vent.Okay, I'm trying to be as brief as possible. I'm 17 years old and I've been depressed for three years. Years of PMO (porn, masturbation, and orgasm) have ruined my life. It has caused me health issues, both physically and mentally. The time that PMO took up, I could have used towards better activities. It most likely was a major contributing factor to my depression as well. PMO even led me to get into weird fetishes (which is the case with most PMO people) - eventually incest came into play. Last year I almost committed an incestual act with my own mother, and these experiences keep coming back to haunt me. I'm being haunted by my own past. Keep in mind, I was also on Zoloft last year for my depression. While it did help, it probably led me to committing a stupid and vile act such as that above. Now I'm actively rebooting (basically giving yourself a rest from PMO and artificial stimuli like porn) and I seem to be pretty successful in doing so. I'm just bothered by my past and the fact that I feel like a total loser for the stuff I did in my past. Also, I'm essentially a high school drop out - I'd always had problems attending school, even when I was very young. I'd always hated school for SOME reason. Anyways, right now I'm trying my best to get right with God and accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. I repent for all of the stuff that I did in my past and I want to change. But it feels so hard to change when you're really down and depressed. My life went even more downhill right after I weaned off of my anti depressant, but I feel that I HAD to do it. I feel much more mentally clear now that I'm off of it, but simultaneously more depressed and discouraged. Suicidal thoughts plague me everyday but I really feel that I don't have the guts to commit suicide. Anywho, thanks for listening.",suicide
4136,"Free, no BS, tutoring office hours style on twitch. I'll be around for the next two hours or so if you have any questions that I might be able to help with  

Right off the bat, this is 100% completely free. I don't ask for donations and I don't want donations. I am so committed to this that I have promised to donate any money received to charity, and I'll post the receipt on the discord to prove it.

Now that's out of the way, Hi! I'm Arch, a college graduate waiting to get into medical school. In this next year I want to give back a little bit to the community and thought that tutoring could be a useful service to offer. My sister is a teacher, and she's told me that the pandemic has been really hard on a lot of students. That is why I am offering office-hours-style tutoring on twitch. I figure twitch is a good way for people to show up and ask questions without needing to sign up and lose their anonymity. I am a neuroscience major with a minor in astronomy. That means I have plenty of experience with the core three sciences and can (hopefully) help explain some of the more difficult concepts to you should you need some assistance.

Again, this is not for money or for karma or for clout. Show up for five minutes, ask a question, and leave without a second glance or follow or whatever. This is supposed to be a no pressure environment where students can get some additional help if they need it. Come and check it out if you want or send the link on to a friend if you know they are struggling with something in school. Absolutely no personal information is required. No names, no emails. Jump on twitch and ask a question in the chat, or follow the link to my discord in case you need to post a picture of a problem etc. There are no stupid questions. All I ask is that you be kind and courteous to anyone else in the stream and that you forgive me if I cannot answer your question.

(I am not going to do your homework for you. Just want to help with conceptual issues.)

The twitch is [twitch.tv/archexplains](https://twitch.tv/archexplains)

And you can find more information and clips from previous streams on my website: [archexplains.org](https://archexplains.org/)

I want this to be a resource that anyone can use for a quick question or for in depth help. If you have any ways that I could improve the service please do not hesitate to let me know. Seriously, I just want to help, I know how frustrating these subjects can be when you feel like you need to teach them to yourself.

If you stumble across this later, my streaming schedule is on the twitch page so check in for the next time I will have office hours.",non-suicide

4149,"Concerned for a friend, advice?I'm quite concerned for a friend of mine, who refuses to get help other than to talk to me and a few other people. To start with, both he and I are in High School, which should give you some idea of where he is.

For the past 10 months or so, he's been depressed pretty much constantly, to varying degrees. At times he's been mostly okay, but it's never a sure indicator. Currently, he says he's not currently actively suicidal, but he thinks a lot about suicide and various methods. In short, suicidal ideation.

I've asked him to promise that if he's ever actively suicidal, he'll call me, a suicide hotline, or 911. He's said he can't promise that.

Basically, I'm asking for advice. I've been depressed before, I was even actively suicidal twice, but what helped me doesn't seem to be helping him, which isn't exactly surprising. I'm quite concerned for him, his depression has been getting worse over the past few months.

4159,"Hi guys, I am having suicidal thoughts :) I have been through a rough year.But like I have read across this subreddit, we can't take our lives, because so many people love us, and I am young. I am only 21, however I have been through hell this year. I would like to tell my story, and perhaps someone might have some input or something to say about it. 

I am a man. I am quite and attractive young man, and this year I went on a date with a man that lived 2 minutes from my house. I met him on tinder, he seemed safe. 

I have many social contacts around the world, that I know well, and that care about me a lot. 

It turns out that the friendly neighbour  had psychopathic tendencies. I believe he is a genuine psychopath. He was gaslighting me and controlling me 24/7 to the point where I lost my mind and he did his best to get my to kill myself.  

I did try to take my life, and I was miraculously saved by my friend  and sent to hospital. 

I was misdiagnosed with psychosis and put on a high dose of one of the strongest drugs in the world, it is called respiridone. Respiridone is like cement to the Brain. It stops you from processing your surroundings. It was unbelievably painful, emotionally and physically. 

Being put in hospital was embarrassing socially, having my entire social network believe that I have been psychotic.

The psychopath comes to hospital and announces himself as my partner to the nurses and doctors, and they encourage me to date him. 

I was too confused on the Brain cement drug to realise that The psychopath was bad, that I agree to be his partner. 

He sexually abused me and took control of me to the extreme. Sleep deprivation and gaslighting. I was emotionally drained from the relationship. He demanded more from me than anyone else could ever do. 

He made me come off the cement medicine immediately. It is supposed to be tapered down over many years. 

Risperidone withdrawals take away all your life memories and all your consentration, so you are left with no understanding of the world and you have extrapyramidal symptoms, such as tardive dyskinesia and akathesia. They are the worst pains one can have in life. Akathesia feels like every single cell in your legs are itching. 
I had so much to deal with, my Brain was physically shaking. I couldn't even understand how to play a simple mobile game. And little did I know, I was being controlled by a psychopath the whole time.
He gave me alcohol and pain medicine, which made the withdrawal pain worse. He is a nurse, he would have known that the meds and alcohol was bad. 
I survived by playing subway surfer. Thank god I figured out that playing a mobile game would be a good idea for my survival. 
After 45 days of intense pain and confusion, the risperidone withdrawals were over, and I completely dissociate and depersonalise to the point where I feel like an organism floating in space. I said to the psychopath on the phone ""my Brain has reset, I can see that life is 100% meaningless. I looked at the moon and it just felt sad, and in my duress the psychopath says to me I CANT HELP YOU IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE ME AS A STEPPING STONE.    How terrifying is it to be feeling like an organism floating in space, and be told you can't be helped unless you give your life to someone else that you don't even know or like. So I had to pretend to like him for him to help me. 

My Brain did that dissociation and depersonalisation to me to protect myself from the realisation I had, which was that the person that was ""helping Me"" was actually not helping me at all. 
I then came back to life miraculously and find out that the psychopath had stolen all our jewellery. 
And he messaged me and said ""what are you doing, where are you"" and I said, I am just at the doctor, and he says ""I thought you would be into pingaz"" and I said to him, I have severe ptsd, I have to process everything, and he comes and knocks on my window.  It was Avery distressing experience to have the most evil person on the planet knocking on your window. 

I then spent the next 2 months in a state of confusion and pain and I even screamed in the doctors office. I screamed at my face in terror and pain. 

I then messaged the psychopath telling him how abusive he is, and he replies ""Don't try and put guilt on me, your mental illness was slowly degrading, and I was helping you the whole time.""  I then immediately was sent to hospital in an intense state of pure 100% grief. I cried down the whole hospital. 

The thing is, I never had a mental illness, he was making me believe that I was mentally ill so that he could control me and use me as a sex slave basically. 

He took control of my Facebook account for the 2 months that I was in a state of confusion, so I don't know who he has messaged. 

I have now lost my entire social life, I am dealing with this distressing experience, my family doesn't want me to die, and my Brain hasn't recovered from respiridone. 

I have survived. 
I have a miraculous story of survival. 

I don't want to die now. That would be complete failure after this distressing experience. 

So I am now in bed, and I am not really functioning very fabulously, I have been given benzodiazepines by the doctor. 
The doctor heard my story. I wonder if the doctor gave me those pills so that I could take my life. 
I have a sneaky suspicion that he did give me those pills so that I could commit suicide, however I also believe that he wants to help me. He says the Brain heals. 

I want to study at university. However the psychopath has changed his university preference to the same university that I was planning to go to. Terrifying. 


I have survived, and my life is no longer dangerous. However I cannot stay in this state for the rest of my life. I am wondering if I should take out life insurance and save the pills and commit suicide next year perhaps? 

Or perhaps I should give my life a go, or I don't know. 
I survived the 45 days of extreme pain and confusion by a not of paper that I wrote, it said ""pain is for good"" and ""the world needs me. I can find meaning in striving"" 

I have survived, and I also want to find meaning in striving, and I feel that the world needs me also. 

So that is my story. It is clearly a dramatic story. I haven't really told it like this to anyone before. 

I want to live life really badly, and I am living life. There are so many years left to live, I can live until 90 if I wish. However I am unsure if my Brain will heal, or what I should do.  I also am concerned with the trauma of having close friendship end because they have distanced themselves from me due to this being too much for them to handle. I don't think it's easy for a best friend to hear that a psychopath was gaslighting them and tried to kill them. What do you guys think. 

My body has almost killed itself actually many times dealing with this dramatic experience. At 3 points I have felt my body die, bust strangely I have woken up in the morning alive. 
I have used phenergan for sleep. 
I see myself and my family as intelligent for surviving this. 
I have used many techniques for survival. I recommend ""tapping for trauma"" videos on YouTube. I also recommend BrainHQ for brain training. The Brain is connected to the body, so exercise changes the way we think. Exercise and swimming  is fantastic. Also I believe in a spiritual world. I believe in family and support. I believe God has done miracles in me. Everyone has weird and wonderful thoughts. If you have a thought you don't like, you can say ""thank you thought, I'll think about you later"" . I also use subway surfer and the game ""air shootout"". 

However I am tired now from this experience, and honestly I wish I could just announce to I the world that I would like to have assisted suicide maybe, so that I can just leave and be finished with this drama. However at the same time I don't really want to die. Death is not what I want, I want a life that isn't so terrifying, at the same time my dream in life is to be in hospital on life support and celebrate hearing the beeping end ------",suicide

4163,"So I slapped my sister today. This is a long post (Serious) I'm currently sobbing in my god damn room.

Backstory on me, this is how I'm trying to ""defend myself"" I guess. So, I did boxing for a couple years, which helped with my anger management a bit. But due to covid, and other issues even before that, I haven't punched anything properly for 2+ years, and anger is still building up in me, every single day. Main source of it is my sister. Multiple times a day, I imagine myself just exploding in anger out of nowhere in my room, completely trashing it. That's the verge I am on, constantly. I do, however have developed a level of self control to not do anything violent. This is how I'm living right now.


So, what happened was: Mom said something to me, to which I replied full normally, TO WHICH, that **bitch** of a sister I have, started provoking me like:  *nAh I wOn'T* (in that bitchy annoying copy voice they do) [my sister is 19, so 1,5 years older than me]

Yes it triggered me, to which she continued.
I said I'm gonna punch her if she continues - she did. So, I got up, went over to her, and slapped her in the face and went off. 2 seconds later she's bombarding over to me, grabbing my hair and kicking me, yelling at me ***HOW DARE YOU SLAP ME, YOU DICK!! HOW DARE YOU SLAP YOUR SISTER!***

Mom did not want to intervene, I understand. I was furious and you know when you hit that point when you don't cry, and you're just laughing in agony, that was me. Sister came over AGAIN, and hit me in the head twice more. That was the point when I started crying. Mom just said to us: ""I don't want to get between you two, fight it off, but not in here"", but I was already grabbing my boxing gloves, and I was ready to fucking go.

I told my sister: I'm gonna go over there. I am going to.

She said: no you fucking won't cause it's my room!

I said: okay then come over here, will ya!? 

She came. 

At first, I was just standing there, like ""you wanna go, bitch?""
And so I did, and I hit her on the arm and legs on one side. She went back to her room, and I sat down. Then it was just yelling from my part, with pure anger, on how much I fucking hate her, and I want her dead, etc, the usual furious mindless stuff.

This went down in max 4 minutes. It was like 20 minutes or so ago. My head is starting to hurt, not from the punches, but from the bawling. I have not had a fight with anyone in the past 3 years. It kinda felt good tbh. 

In conclusion: my sister had absolutely zero reasons to start provoking me, and I TOLD HER the consequences, and she still ignored it.


Right now she's acting like nothing happened. Yes, I shouldn't have punched her. But imagine keeping all your emotions bottled up, and then getting that one last drop in the already full cup.

4192,"My friend's situation is really bad, should I tell his parents?My friend is an introvert and he is really shy. There's a girl that he ""indirectly"" likes. He keeps thinking about her, and gets jealous if some guy, or say, any guy talks to her, in the college. He even warned a guy to stay away from her. And also called a guy who he thought was talking to her, just to check. And he sometimes spaces out, becomes blank, and tears start coming from his eyes.

He also says and thinks that everyone in the college is better than him, and also that he is a ""hopeless piece of shit"". And also that he doesn't have any talent or whatsoever, and just wants to give up. He also tells me that everyone in his class thinks he is a ""loser"", and no one wants to talk to him. 

Me and my other friend are trying everything we can, to help him. But we are limited by the business in our own individual lives. What do we do to help him?

Apart from that, he was also involved in a toxic relationship with a couple. The girl would annoy him telling him why isn't her boyfriend messaging her. And he (my friend) would also talk to that ""Boyfriend"" all the time, and even play online games with him, and then at one point, he grew really annoyed of my friend's messages, and told him to stay away.

And also, there is too much workload on him right now, from his college. 

And yesterday, as it turns out, he tried to ""kill himself"".  It was night, I was leaving his home, and then he insisted that he comes to drop me off. I said okay. 

But this time, he chose his car, rather than his two-wheelers... I asked him whether he drove car everyday for college, and he said no. I also asked him whether he drove it before this time, he also said no. The tone of his reply was monotonic... he replied with no interest, and then after dropping me off, we said bye, and then he was off his home. But I waited for him to take a U-turn, so I could see him returning his home. It was just a hunch. But I didn't see him take the turn, instead he took another road.

He was all alone in the car, filled with misery and pain, probably driving on the highway, with no one inside...  

And then I got a reply from him saying that he has reached home. 

And now he uses me and my other friend as a ""diary"". He constantly texts us whatever comes up in his mind, including his negative thoughts and what others think of him. 

So I'm planning to put an end to this, tomorrow, by telling his mother (who is the only person there currently), while my other friend takes him to a garden. But the feeling of doubt I get is, what if she treats him badly after listening to me? And it becomes more worse for him?

Though there was time when I saw his mother be sympathetic to him when he got low grades in the final exam of our 12th class... but I still don't know if it's a good idea.

P.S. I also tried telling his mother yesterday, but he was there, and dragged my shirt and stopped me. He kept saying, ""Please, you don't know everything, please."" And most of the time, the talk wasn't even in person. He would text me, rather than speak to me directly. ""You are the only person I can trust."" ""If not you, then whom?""

4199,"I Truly Hate LivingObligatory I'm on mobile, so format will be unadulterated trash, as well as this is decently lengthy, get a snack.


I cannot remember a single day of my pitiful existence being remotely enjoyable. Every memory seems to be, at best, apathy. At worst, my memories are filled with contempt. Even my dreams are plagued with a call to the proverbial void.


Between the excessive feeling of self hatred, loneliness, failure, mental disarray, and overall depression, I'm beginning to have the wonderful nag of self termination (I'd say suicide but let me be a bit avant garde, that word began to bore me with time). Each day feels dreadfully extended. Every second is filled with a feeling I could almost describe as regret to my birth. It certainly does not help that I cannot connect with other people. 


I have friends, had friends, and will have friends, but, they all feel so 2 dimensional. As if I can only observe them and not interect(if that is a clear description of the phenomena). Because of this looming emotional flaw, I will never have a relationship that feels gratifying for the sake of love. Never can I be involved in romance, as I am incapable of expressing depth of such a remarkable emotion. To those who can or do still love, whether superficially or deeply, cling to such a miracle. 


I only fail in school. My motivation erodes with every second, leaving me nothing more than a disappointment whom steadily adds to debt. What was I thinking, engineering is for those who seek a better world, I want to escape it. With each failure, I see more reason to flee from my self created hell. 


If only I could properly type the details of my suffering, it is all too existential to describe in clarity. Let it be known, in my few moments of lucidity, I demand my death from myself. Purpose never having existed, happiness but a fleeting memory, and suffering all encompassing, the only bulwark against my imminent display of cranial ballistic testing is a macabre curiosity of tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day.


If you made it this far, than you have my thanks. Yet, I have a request. Reddit, do tell me why I shouldn't take a visit to the lead express while having my last cigarette.

The system as is prioritizes the analysis of information. This itself is not the problem, rather it is the prioritization of material within individual subjects.

There is no career that seems interesting to me, dead end jobs seem even worse and my family don't seem to understand. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet it because I haven't thought of a cool way to do it. I'm being serious, if my life is so bleak and uninteresting I might as well make my death quite fucking spectacular. I also don't want to ruin anybody else's life in the process. For example, I jump off a building and hit a concrete floor, I wouldn't want some poor bastard to find my mangled body. I shoot myself in the head, what about the person who finds that mess? No. Not like that.

I'm at rock bottom, the lowest I have ever been in all my life. I almost wish I was religious, maybe I could turn to a god for help at this time. I also wanted to add that I haven't killed myself because of my dad. I am his only son. My mother had a child to a different man so she would still have another son. I'm not saying that my dad would feel worse, both parents would be completely destroyed if I killed myself but you guys know what I mean? I don't think he'd have many reasons to live if I did it, whereas my mother would be stronger for my brother's sake.

He calmed down and apologized afterwards, but I cannot trust him with this anymore. I will *never* forget him telling me to kill myself, even as he and the rest of my family were a major reason for me not doing it.

So much homework and expectations from my parents mixed with work and sports wore me out. For the past few months, I haven't been able to do homework. It woulod get to the point where I would curl up on the floor and just cry. I would often think about hurting or killing myself, but not really planning how. Besides when I was in school, I would think during class about all the places I could potentially jump off of. Furthermore, I've always had sort of this fear that my friends and other people I know will just stop talking to me one day or they'll be mad at me for some reason. This has gotten worse since graduation is coming up.

----My best friend (who is a girl, I'm a guy) knows everything I've said so far, besides specifics about harming myself.---

Now here is where I need advice. Most of these feelings of fear of people being mad at me are from my best friend. Anytime she doesn't text me back, or doesn't say hi to me or someting, my mind goes strait to ""oh she's annoyed with me"" or something like that. It's driving me insane. I don't know If I should tell her this or not.

In case you were wondering, I do have feelings for her. We've been good friends for about 3 years and I have been friendzoned by her before. We hung out last Sunday, and we had a good time and we cuddled 'n' stuff. But then we had a campout for with our senior class on Tuesday, and I had lots of issues with the above problems the entire time. Her and I talked about a little bit at the campout but I had very little fun the entire time. She doesn't seem the same towards me after this campout. I really feel like I wrecked something between us that night, and it's all my fault. I basically forced myself to have a bad time and now it's tearing me apart. 

She will be calling late tonight because I basically begged her to. I told her I need to talk about something  before I do something stupid (I meant hurt myself, but I didn't tell her that). What I really need to talk to her about is basically this whole deal and I don't know if I should tell her that many of my anxiety issues are from worrying if she'll still care about me in the morning. I didn't lie to her when I said I might do something stupid, though.

4269,"My friend has worked on a project for over 8 months üìÜ, to help you make friends! Match up with questions üë• based on age, gender, interests, continent, willingness to share pictures or voice calls, studying/working status and more üì∑ üó∫Ô∏è üìûüöÄ! Hello, finally something positive that came out of 2020, this project matches people up based on answers to 28 questions. Basically you choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28 questions, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. For example you could say you're looking for people from **Europe**, who are **16-25**, who **are** willing to do **voice calls**, and they're also **studying** and have interests in **dinosaurs, minecraft or biology.** Also quite handy, there is a filter to not match with ""*low effort*"" (based on word count) users.

What is the final result? The algorithm searches over 3500 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get around 20-40 **matches** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

The last tip I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

I want to clear things out that I've never been diagnosed by a medical professional with depression, neither have I ever been in touch with a medical professional. The thing is, I've been really down lately and life has been dealing me with shit lately. I've been struggling with my own mental health which I will get to in a moment. I guess I'll cut this thing on segments and hope that you won't find me really weird.   
The first section would be;  


**My Story**

So, I live in the Philippines and I'm a male. I've had a really shitty childhood because of a bad environment. My parents, athough they are still arranging for an annulment, have been split since my childhood and this was most likely because of my father's personality. My father is an alcoholic, manipulative and cheater. He has three wives (one of which doesn't even know about the other one, and yes, she does know about my mother and my sister) . Because of the split, my mother had to work 6 days of the week and would only often visit during the Sunday's, sometimes she won't even come home. I was left with my sister, a maid, and my grandfather. Now, my grandfather who is now deceased, always gave me a punishment every single time of every single day and he would only do so when my mother is not around. (I don't really know why he did it,, I guess I was the only one he could express the anger on my father to.) and my third maid (yes, we had a lot) would also abuse me and take me to a gambling den. I became rebellious and would only cause trouble, which in turn made my grandfather hate me more and more as time passes on. It only changed when my father decided to step in my life at the age of 9 and I told him about the abuse my mother's side has caused me... So he decided to move me with my aunt and he would also pay for my education and everything. Now, it might seem as if my father is a good person but as I've told you, he is really manipulative... More on that later... Now life with my aunt and grandma (from my father side) really went like what it was like with my mother's side with the difference of they never became physical to me. They would verbally abuse me and would always tell me that what I feel doesn't matter. It made what I was at that point in time worse and if it wasn't for a friend who saw me standing on the side of the condominiums rooftop I would have never been here. As a quick side note though,  I'm really glad that now as I've grown up my aunt and grandma has changed their hearts, although my grandma has passed away, my aunt really cares about me this days and I love her. After all this mess, there is one thing in my whole side and a lot of people suffer this that I can't let go and this is the issue with mental health. My family doesn't care for my mental health and this just got worse during the whole COVID-19 situation. 

**What's happening?**  


Quick side note: There was this time when I was grieving over the loss of my grandmother on my father's side and my father was the one who caused my lovely grandmother's death. My grandmother was set for a therapy after she was stricken by stroke but a day before my father decided to tease my grandma about how she was going to die which angered my grandma and in turn made here lose it and get attacked by a brain aneurysm. I was really upset with my father but things turned on the day before my grandma's burial. My father had arrived that day and was just making things worse for a grieving son. I finally snapped after he verbally abused me for not preparing stuff such as clothings, gadgets, and etc. LIKE DUDE YOU FUCKING KILLED MY GRANDMA WHO HAD TO DO YOUR FUCKING ROLE AS A FATHER FOR YOU AND NOW YOU'RE INSULTING ME FOR NOT PREPARING STUFF AS IF I HAD HOPED FOR MY GRANDMA TO DIE YOU STUPID FUCKING TWAT. I HAD PLANS OF PAYING BACK TO MY GRANDMA AFTER HER YEARS OF TAKING CARE OF ME AND YOU RUINED IT.   


Anyways, things got heated and I never apologized to my father and so did he. This will become relevant later.  


Well , my father decided to stay with my aunt and I as a way to access his work easier. The bummer is he got locked here with me during the quarantine and because of this he truly revealed what kind of a monster he was.. He was really toxic to me and never respected me as a son because of the previously stated story.. He sees me as a baby, a stupid person who doesn't respect him. My father has a really toxic trait of a nice guy,, he will do something good, in this case pay for my acads, as a way for me to respect him. I am basically his Trust Fund, his life insurance...  and he thinks that I should respect him no matter what treatment he gives to me. He has done this to everyone and it is I who has broken the stigma. I didn't follow their tracks and because of that almost everyone in my family thinks that I am just a rebellious son who doesn't understand my father's hard work. But that's just dumb. If my father didn't leave us, cheat on my mother and became a good father then this would have never happened. If only he had finished studying as an engineer and didn't back out then he would have never became such an oppressed worker. If only he had thinked about his actions... This of course made us a conflicting pair.   


There was one time where he was trying to invade my privacy through reading my stuff and when I got pissed he answered, ""You take that privacy bullshit way too much"" to which I responded, ""Yah? Well in that case can I read your texts with Jane? (Jane is her mistress and Jane and my mother's side has accepted her as a part of the family so this wasn't supposed to be really offensive to him because umm duh?) "" and he got pissed.. Which resulted on him physically hurting me..  


Things get worse as the day's go by, especially today as my father became really toxic to me again and my girlfriend and I are having a fight.. I've ben really struggling these days and I dying has been a daily option nowadays.. But I think I'll keep on fighting.. but if I do lose... I love you all :&gt; Thank you for reading",suicide

4278,"Too many words to describe it, few weeks to convey itHello. I don't know who cares to to read this at this late of an hour or who puts much thought into it as well. I don't know exactly why I'm doing this or what I hope to achieve. I am a 20 year old young adult in college and working a steady job, living with my brother, mother, and step-father. I have a sister whose moved out and is having a successful life. I'm quite close to everyone in my family, I buy my own things, make or purchase hot meals, and try to enjoy things while making my way through my life. Even going to college and attending classes in my third year. I'm even openly homosexual and my family accepts me for that, even told them when I was very young. I also apologize for those who read this thick wall of text, it's like a cinder block.

I should grateful, right? I should feel like I'm normal and happy. I should feel like I can look at my future with any modicum of optimism and hopefulness. That I should be happy that I have my own things, I even own my own car, pay for my own phone, and so on. Aren't these supposed to be the elements of hard-working, young adults life that help me feel like I'm getting somewhere? In truth, through my eyes, no matter what I do, try, or work towards, I have no future. I have no idea where I want to go with my life or what I want to do. I wake up with the dread of simply existing, the days I have my college classes through the day I feel like I simply go to satisfy some requirement to pass the class, get the good grade and move on without understanding why I'm doing it. Why am I shoveling myself in student debt in hopes that I'll figure out a plan that will help with my life, to make my family proud as the youngest son, or to feel like I'm actually earning an education when I BARELY passed high school (because screw you math). I had to force myself to go this year, otherwise I might have never gone back. I wonder what's the point of working a job that I don't completely enjoy (construction clean-up), and I only have the job because of my step-father and mother, because they work it together. I rarely only ever talk about this stuff with my mother, but at times it's brief and I don't say too much, and whatever I do say I ask her just to forget about it.

I have, as stereotypical as it sounds, no real social life. I don't talk to many people aside from family, I have a small circle of online friends I feel quite close to, but of course that's no real replacement for a relationship with a real person. I try to be more out there, to have the desire to actually build a social life, but I can't find the desire or motivation to do it. The only moments where I don't feel that anxiety is when I'm by myself, in my room, sitting with my laptop and just...staring at the screen. I've also never gone to a doctor to get diagnosed for depression. Never really have the time for it, too busy with doing work which I feel unhappy with and going to school which I don't feel like I'm actually doing anything there anymore. Even if I go to see a doctor and get diagnosed with depression, I would refuse any sort of anti-depressants or medicine of that type. I feel sick at the idea of needing a drug to help me control my own messed up mind, when I was younger I took medicine to help me sleep, and now I have that under control and sleep normally, I even have a pretty decent sleep schedule.

So, what's the point of all this rambling? Of me, some random stranger talking about himself on a reddit board about depression?

I feel like I am a burden. That every moment of my existence that isn't spent being a useful person or helpful to anyway, to any moment I see like a homeless person and drive by, to seeing other people with good hearts doing things that I fail to do, it feels like I shouldn't be around. There are so many good people in the world, all of them living happy lives with hope and idea of what they want to do with themselves while I sit here, rambling on and bumbling about with not having fathomed a single idea of what the hell I want to do with myself in the future. I'm 20 years old and I'm not even at the starting line yet, and I only have myself to blame. I also feel like I am a burden to my mother. Every moment I'm not spending doing anything I can trying to ease her life, considering she took the time to take care of her kids, my passed away grandmother when we moved in with her some time ago, and going through a divorce from a crappy husband, all those times I feel like I am nothing but a failure. Every moment I'm not working to earn money, every penny I don't give to my mother to ease her burden, are times I feel like it would simply be better if I sold every single thing I own, left the envelope of money in her room, and left and never came back. One less mouth to feed, right? One less useless piece of garbage she has to look at. I have no future, no end goal, and any type of objective I try to set for myself, like deciding what career I want or something like that, I know I'm not smart enough or good enough at anything to do it. I have no talent in anything. I'm not smart, I'm not very good looking, and my speech skills are in the negatives. Who'd want to hire a useless blob?",suicide
4279,Need help. Getting depressed about thinking about the pastMy wife and I met in high school our sophomore year. It was great until senior year. I broke it up with her senior year because I wanted to hang out with my friends more and I felt like she was too clingy. We started talking again a little after high school. But we were in the friend's stage. She would go out with some guys just to make me jealous (she told me this later). And we got back together before she could get in a committed relationship. So fast forward seven years to the present we been married and we just talking about old times and talking about high school and she tells me that she indeed slept with a friend of mine while we were broken up. To me I'm shocked and now I just can't stop picturing it in my mind of the image of those two having sex. Since we dated so young I never had really never had sex with anyone else except her( very embarrassing to say but I want you to get where I'm coming from. So to me sex is something that is special) and now everyday I just picture what they could have done like all the positions and stuff and all the stuff before sex. She says it didn't mean anything and she was trying to make me jealous at the time but felt bad after so thats why she never told me. I know she didn't do anything wrong because we were broken up but now when I see her or at work thats all I can imagine. Am I insane and making too much of it? she hates talking about it so it's hard just to tell her how I feel but I just picture them so vividly. It been getting me depressed and been seeing a doctor about it but still that doesn't help. So i don't know what else to do. How do i stop picturing it?

I don't know what was wrong with me as a child but I would stress myself out about absolutely everything, to the point where I couldn't breathe, and I still do to this day. It eventually drove me to the point where I accepted death as a possible way out in situations, of which I would think about daily... It was at that moment that I felt something broke, because since I was around 13 (I'm currently 18) this urge to just end it all, to avoid all future stress, has grown to the point where I'm becoming dangerously close.
It's evolved past the point of being linked to depression, or stress, or anxiety. This urge to end everything is becoming completely independent from my emotional state, and I feel it constantly now. 
I've already tried to hang myself a few times, then cry myself to sleep when it didn't work. I used to do it as a way to scare myself back into shape, but the more I do it, the more I realize that in all honesty I just don't want to be alive anymore, and each time I do it I get a little closer to completely losing consciousness and becoming brain dead in that tight, embracing rope.

I guess this is a cry for help. I used to talk to friends about this, but I told everyone that I'm fine now, deep down I know it'd be easier to kill myself if they weren't worried about me...

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Dom. I'm 21 years old male.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets start about my life really quick.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my life since my childhood was really unsuccesfull and full of things that not any kid wants to deal with..

I got often beaten by my dad or being just nothing to my mom/dad. I never got any gifts and I was one of these kids that sees getting their mom beaten to blood by (dad).. or 24/7 cops at our house. I'm not saying it randomly but it left serious wounds on me.. My whole life was surrounded by them not helping me w school or anything related to it or not even helping me with homeworks..  and since that time my mom become a serious bitch.. In my whole life I never got any happiness except some things like having someone by my side. I become seriously addicted to League of Legends 10 years ago and it just destroyed my whole life as well. I tried so hard that it become even worse and I dropped from school 3 times.. In 2013-2014 I tried to attempt suicide that was about to be done because I couldnt take it anymore. So I took knife and pointed it near my neck because of bullshit cuz my mom didnt let me to go to my grandmother.. (My grandmother&amp;Uncle) are only ones who really cared of me.. Bought me clothes, computer, paid bills when I told them that one day im going to be something and had food all the time.. And really cared even for my school or I would end up even worse. When I pointed that knife I really cried and wanted to end it because my whole life was about to be at least once happy and I never felt it.. When these days went over I went back to my stuff and started playing League more and more.. I had back in days girlfriend that I wanted for whole year and guess what? I was really fucked up in my mind that I just keep blocking her everywhere.. called her really bad words, made her cry and manipulated w her so much.. that she decided that she will leave me.. Another attempt of suicide when I almost did exactly same shit like I did before.. knife boom and nothing.. 2 years later I found another one which cheated on me.. perfect timing! When I was almost out of my fucking 24/7 watching my first one and here it is again.. (Actually it did nothing with me).. Nothing happened after all.. We never did talk again. All I got was blame for no reason?.. 2 another years I found my current girlfriend that makes me happy everyday.. but times are different and it started to be even worse.. I'm feeling like people cant control me anymore and neither I can. I'm back in my old days when my anxiety shows up more and my agoraphobia or even worse things are becoming real like I never felt them before.. I'm more and more scared of people.. more likely I dont want to leave my house anymore and in the end the whole story is about that I'm really antisocial and I have no idea how to move.. My hardest thing to do is to go into job.. I just cant and its hillarious.. I can try as much as I can but its just hard.. hard to accept that my comfort zone will be gone.. (Yeah, I never left my house anywhere alone for years..) It's just hard and I cant do it.. I have even problems to go alone into shop.. The thing is that I used to be a lot center of laugh at school for having bad clothes or not looking perfectly.. I never had any friends that would stand up and go say its going to be alright. My only friends are just friends that im playing League with and in the end its just pointless.  


I want to say one thing in the end. My life is really complicated one and I have no idea how to do it anymore. My life and relationship w mom got even worse and its about to be destroyed completely and ill get kicked from house.. and then? I'll probably end myself because its just how it is. I love my life only because of my girlfriend otherwise I would be really dead by this day.. And since things going in wrong place.. who knows what will be in upcoming months.. I'm going to leave it here and if I just one day dont respond.. its just done.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not planning any suicide but just saying its hard to life my live when you got nothing else than hate.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not drinking or even smoking.. I'm having heart problems, legs problems and im colorblinded + probably even my mentality is fucked up. I'm trying to reflect my mirror = dad. Hes the one who used to smoke, do drugs, and beat my mom to blood.. + me..

It's weird, I've got a great job, a girl, and a safe place to live, and family and friends that love and support me.

Distract yourself, journal, make a list of pros and cons, deep breathing, talk to a friend.  To that, I say ha! None have worked.

4375,"Scar tissueI‚Äôm suicidal. I had things happen to me as a child that unknowingly shaped the way I transitioned into manhood. When I realized I had problems and was tired of being a person impaired by their own toxic mindset, I‚Äôd tell myself I‚Äôd change but couldn‚Äôt do it. Mental block. They weren‚Äôt just words to me, but words to a woman I loved dearly. After I lost her ‚Äì the kindest, most loving woman I have ever had in my life ‚Äì I figured that if I couldn‚Äôt fix myself for the greatest thing to every happen to me, then I was never going to change. The only solution was to kill myself. And not just to end my own depression, but as punishment for the pain I was causing myself.

I was getting better. I found some help here and decided that the precursors to who I am are not my fault, and who I became was uncontrollable. But who I can become in the future is my choice. I detached my mind from my emotions and inspected myself, found things I simply wasn‚Äôt going to do anymore. Not only was I going to do it for myself, I was going to do it for the woman I love. My actions would speak louder than words and she could return to the man she fell in love with but without the toxicity of secrets and demons.

They say you shouldn‚Äôt dwell on the past, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs always true. I wanted to use the scar tissue of new and old wounds to remind myself of a path I‚Äôd never go down again.

Tonight, I met her for the second time after I told her I was bettering myself ‚Äì the revelation that led to her to start communicating with me again. We went out, had a few drinks. She probed me and I let loose. I answered her questions, told her about the things that happened to me as a kid. Then when she pushed me on what I was doing and how deep my problems go, I told her about suicide. How seeds have been planted in my head and while I don‚Äôt want to do it now, I know I will later. I know how things begin, but I‚Äôve stopped that now. And I‚Äôm a million times better already, even if my journey has only started.

She clammed up. The revelation made her freeze. She didn‚Äôt say anything else. I got emotional. I sat down and reassured her that I was OK ‚Äì I‚Äôm getting help. I‚Äôm getting better. She still said nothing. I poured my heart out, revealed my dreams and aspirations of showing her my change, that I loved her and understood why she left me. 

The love of my life asked me to explain how I understood her‚Ä¶ how I‚Äôd understand putting everything in and getting nothing back would make me feel the other person doesn‚Äôt love me. 

Right after that, she said she had to go and off she went into the sunset. No response, no nothing. Here I am, back to square one. It‚Äôs like no matter what I do, no matter what positive path I try to take, no matter how fucking hard I battle with myself and try my hardest to kill the monsters inside me, somehow, regardless of how far I go, I end up where I fucking started.

The past couple of weeks have been some of the most rough in my life, and that is saying so much. Every thing is crumbling around me. My mind is broken. 

I had been afraid that I pushed my dearest friend away. I've been intense lately, and I have not too many other people that I can open up to. I know I'm too much. I know that -- all I do is throw sick weight onto my loved one's shoulders. 

I've been watching videos of people dying. Suicides are my favorite, and especially ones with guns. I've gotten into murder videos, freak accidents, and torture. Never -- never have I liked this sort of thing. Seeing hurt has always made me sick. But I love it now. It is so soothing and pleasurable to watch these videos. It is my only release. Drugs/meds have always just been cheap masks that didn't make me feel real pleasure, but when I watch all of this suffering and gore, I am actually calm. 

I'm so filled with hatred. I want to hurt everyone who crosses me. I want these people to hurt! Every fucking day they hurt me. They are always pinning me down and SCREAMING IN MY EARS! I can't get quite anywhere. Everyone's feeling are forced onto me. I just want them to stop it. I want the eyes to leave from me. I've never been in a fight, and believe me I have had opportunity! I've never hurt anyone. But I want to bash and break all of these people who make me feel like complete shit. 

I opened up about this to my friend. And I think I have scared her off. I didn't even give all of these details, but I needed to get this off of my back. I wanted the person I care about the most to know that I am completely breaking. 

What's wrong with me? Why do I lived with the constant urge to end my life? And now -- violence is pounding in my head. And now -- I think I have really turned my friend away from me.

I were never happy. Not that I am not satisfied with everything (I really am), I just never felt joy for about 8 years.


I was never suicidal, friends helped a lot to prevent that, but lately suicide doesn't seem so odd anymore. Why should I continue a life, if I can't feel joy in it? Why should I go on, if not even a life that many people envy can make me happy in the slightest? I just don't see a reason.


I know that I should feel grateful for my life, but I just can't. I can't get motivation to do anything, because I know I won't feel any joy by doing it.

4435,"Finally met a girl, now even that's gone [NSFW]Sorry if I can't explain anything adequately, I'm a really reserved person and usually keep my feelings bottled up to everyone, even my parents. I also apologize if this ends up being a novel, I'm not exactly sure how much info to give but at this point I don't care. Basically I'm an early twenties male going to a small college. In high school, I always kept to myself and only had about 5 friends, all of them were guys. For some reason, I get extremely nervous around girls and always find a way to fuck up a conversation. Every time. I really can't help it... 

When I got to college, I tried getting out of my comfort zone by working out and making myself look the best. I went out a couple of times in hopes of meeting people and also hoped that the alcohol would make it easier to talk to girls. It didn't really. Finally, a friend of mine introduced me to this girl that seemed to be having the same problems as me. I think we hit it off decently well, but it was obvious that I was more shy than her -- like I said, I pathetically barely even talked to girls so I was taking like a couple hours to try to perfect every little text to make sure that I wouldn't fuck anything up. Long story short, we end up having sex (which was my first time) and she asked if I wanted to take the relationship more seriously. She asked me this the weekend after declining to have sex with her because I had to go home for some reason. I can't remember exactly why I had to go home, but my friend apparently was talking to her and started telling me that I needed to give her an answer quickly because I was ""stringing her along."" I got scared shitless because I had never been in a relationship, and after about 10 minutes of being a pussy, I told her no. After this, she kind of stopped talking to me, perhaps rightly so. She asked if we could have still been friends, which I would have liked, but every time I asked her to hang out she said no. After I realized how stupid the decision I made was, I got really depressed. Usually I try to make people laugh, even when I don't feel the best but during the next couple of months I just got really quiet and more reserved. I called my general doctor to ask him for a therapist recommendation and he said the therapist would call back but she never did. 

Fast forward about 4 months, the only times I had seen her since saying no had been around campus and stuff. The most conversation we'd had since then was just occasional hellos. I think time healed me a little as I was feeling not as depressed and was even feeling confident enough to see if she wanted to resume what little relationship we had. I asked my friend that introduced us if he thought she would be down for it, but he told me she was seeing someone. 

Coming closer to the conclusion -- now it was nearing the end of summer and I learned that they weren't together anymore for whatever reason and I again asked my friend if he thought she would be down to start something again. He said that she not only was, but she was pretty excited about it. This got me really excited because I had been waiting a long time for this moment, and she was even seemingly equally happy that it was going to happen. Then, the semester starts. I distinctly remember coming back from a night class and being so happy at the thought that we were going to hang out the next day. Then I received a text that gave me an almost out-of-body experience. She tells me that she is too busy with school and work and that it won't work out. The day before we were going to hang out. It honestly felt like that Reddit story about the guy who lived a whole life for 10 years and then stared at a lamp for 3 days and realized the last 10 years had been a lie. I was so dazed that I felt perpetually high for the next 2 weeks or so. It was like nothing I had ever experienced. Also, again, she said that she'd like to be friends but also said no every time I asked her to hang out. 

Fast forward almost exactly a month later and she's in a relationship. There were many other things that contributed to me wanting to commit suicide, but this was the most significant. Luckily, every other time I thought about it, I felt that I couldn't bring myself to do it but lately I've been feeling like I could. I've been trying to get my mind off of it but I literally can't. I spend whole days doing homework, whole days watching YouTube videos, nothing fucking works. I just keep thinking about it. If anyone had any advice I would appreciate it. Thanks",suicide

4444,"21 year old mother who can't do it anymore. Please, someone help me.I don't know where to begin besides I'm a 21 year old wreck. I have a 2 year old son who means everything to me, and has always helped me push through, but I'm reaching a breaking point.
Backstory: I unexpectedly got pregnant by drug dealer at the time, to be candid I didn't even know his name. I had just graduated high school 3 months prior to finding out I was pregnant. Despite the obstacles, we managed to form a relationship and stay together. Two years into it, the more I got to know him the more I realized he isn't who I want in a life partner. We separated and I am back at home with my mom and dad, who constantly criticize me as a mom. I moved back in with my parents because I work part time and go to school full time. I can't afford a place of my own, and after I separated from my partner I no longer have a vehicle.  Even though I've separated from my former partner he is pushing a relationship. He wants to get married and I don't have the guts to tell him I don't love him. I told him we needed time apart, and that's why I moved out- but in his mind there is still hope. I'm partly to blame because I will use him as an excuse to get out from my parents house for a bit, as he is the only friend my parents will allow me to have. I'm constantly having to lie to everyone just to maintain some sort of peace and a tiny ounce of freedom. It is wrong on so many levels, but I don't know what else to do.
I've always struggled with depression, I've been on medication longer than I can recall- but the medicine just doesn't help. The void and numb feeling I carry reaches the deepest parts of my soul. I feel like I have failed in all aspects. I'm not a good mom to be honest. It tears me apart that I don't have the energy or joy like most parents. My son now cries for my mother instead of me. He doesn't want me to hold him, he isn't ever excited to see me, just her. I just feel hopeless. My parents criticize me for not giving my child a ""stable home"", and not providing him with the ""same opportunities"" that I was afforded growing up. 
There iss so much more to the story, but I'm feeling like I'm rambling. I'm just basically at a point where I feel completely helpless. I feel like everyone (my child included) would be better off if I simply didn't exist. I bought a gun 3 days ago, and I've been fantasizing about pulling the trigger. 

I'm finally ready.

I don't know what made me make an account and post this, I think I just needed to put it out into the universe. I'm a loner who doesn't have any friends, just my coworkers and this isn't something you can just dump on a coworker. 
I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this.

4453,"kinda scared that my mouth breathing habit has changed how I look Ever since I was small I slept with my mouth open. I got braces and they completely fixed my teeth after I got them removed. I‚Äôm happy with my smile and I feel like they kinda changed the shape of my jaw in a good way. The thing is that I still sleep with my mouth open even though I don‚Äôt have breathing problems. It‚Äôs only at night and breathing with my mouth open makes me feel less claustrophobic and it feels better. The orthodontist had told me when I first got braces that my mouth shrunk because I slept with my mouth open. Every time I mention this to people they think it‚Äôs stupid but you‚Äôd think a doctor knows what they‚Äôre talking about. They said that the reason my teeth got messed up in the first place is because my tongue wasn‚Äôt resting against the top of my mouth when I slept. 

I‚Äôm seriously considering sleeping with a sleep tape on my mouth now just so maybe my face might look better. I‚Äôve always thought the way my face looks is kind of odd but it seems like a lot of people don‚Äôt really have a clear idea of how they look. At this point I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm attractive or unattractive but I‚Äôm willing to sleep with my mouth closed if that‚Äôll do anything tbh. The idea that maybe the reason I look weird is all because I sleep with my mouth open is kinda scary and hopefully it‚Äôs not too late to try to fix this. This is basically the reason I got braces in the first place.

I can still see my jawline and I can‚Äôt see my gums when I smile. Overall, I don‚Äôt see too much of the problems that come along with sleeping with your mouth open but maybe that‚Äôs because I got braces at an early age. This ended up being really long and I don‚Äôt think anyone would read all this oh well",non-suicide
4455,"This is pathetic, but I don't know where else to go.I've had a long history of mental illness, complete with one near-successful suicide attempt about five years ago. Recently, I was on the upward swing--feeling good, on a good combination of the right meds, and hadn't self-harmed in almost two years. I was on my way out of therapy, and had been transferred from a specialist to a GP.
Two weeks ago, it was my birthday. I usually hate birthdays, but I managed to have fun this year; I got myself balloons, went out to dinner, saw my boyfriend and got a piercing I'd wanted for months.

Two days ago, I started noticing signs of infection. I went today to get antibiotics, and was planning on gently and quickly switching the jewelery from a ring to curved barbell for comfort's sake. I snapped the ring against my cartilage while taking it out, caused a ton of bleeding and swelling, and couldn't get the barbell in. I am in hysterics. It seems this is all it takes to bring the flood of sadness and suicidal thoughts back.

I want to die. And not because I lost my piercing, but because I am a fucking pathetic piece of shit, who makes a big deal out of everything, ruins everything, makes everyone around me miserable, and generally is a worthless waste of oxygen. I have no future and no one would miss me who wouldn't be better off without me. I am a monster. I am a failure. I am ugly, fat, and volatile. I'm stupid. I'm generally a compilation of every awful quality on the face of the earth, and all it took to remind me was one little failure. Yay for being weak.

I've cried myself sick already, have ruined a late birthday dinner, and am on the verge of breaking my blades back out. The only thing stopping me is that my sheets are white and I don't want to have to clean up the blood.

I'm sorry, reddit. I know I'm being awful and that everyone else here has huge issues to deal with and I'm just really sorry I dont even know why I wrote this. ",suicide

I was there twice, both during the worst parts of my father's alcoholism which came during otherwise really bad times for me. I'm really better now after therapy and don't think about it at all/or if I do only very infrequently. However, when I was at that stage, I thought I was just being a burden to society, my family, and everyone else, that no one would really care and everyone would actually be relieved if I offed myself. It wasn't selfish at all, or at least I didn't think that way at the time. I also didn't view it as a solution to a long-term problem, I viewed myself as the long-term problem and suicide as the long-term solution to that problem.

4463,"Day seven of posting until a homophobe makes a well conceived argument free of falacies Psa: homophobia is a term used to describe a mindset in which one acts or reacts adversely to homosexuals or (in some cases) toward any member of the lgbtq+ community

I have recently seen several occasions where people misuse this term. Whether it is as joking as 'its just a home why would I be afraid of it' to undeniable homophobes saying and I quote (with censoring)  ""why would I be afraid of f***"" this is an issue not only because it makes it harder to debate, but more importantly it trivializes homophobia in all cases. 

In other news I have given up reading the Bible, because I have realized arguments based on religion are flawed for reasons I can understand without having read the entire religious works of said religions. For example, leviticus 20:13 (a very commonly used passage to justify homophobia) can easily be debated against if the person citing it doesn't believe cheating on a spouse should be punished by death. That is unless they can provide an inherent reason for which they believe the moral and not the punishment (feel free to take a swing at this).

I am not sure if this kind of post breaks the subreddit rules and I apologize profoundly if it does. I am a 21 year old male who is unsure of everything. I am so tired of always doubting myself. I can not even finally decide to kill myself. All my life I have worked towards my goals and I usually almost achieve them. I say almost because every fucking time something happens that it out of my control and my dreams are crushed right before me. I got admitted to my dream school for undergrad but because of a revolution in my home country, I couldn‚Äôt attend. Now I got into my dream PhD programs, but because of Corona and the shitiness of my home country I will probably be drafted and will not be able to achieve this goal too. All this along, I did not have friends(every single one of them betrayed me when I needed them most) and the only thing keeping me were my goals. 

I want to die but I do not want to hurt those around me. I am sick and tired of everything, but do not want to hurt my parents.

4546,"My school system is such bullshit. A little while ago, I made a post talking about my regional championship match. I didn‚Äôt think I made it. Well, I actually did qualify. I know, exciting. 

Guess what my school system chose to do.

NOT LET PLAYERS PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE TOURNAMENT!

Why? Because they are worried that other schools attending state would not have the same Covid rules as them. By the way, my school has one of the worst track records with the handling of covid. They just make rules but give no solutions, shocking. But, let‚Äôs give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe, they are generally worried about students spreading Covid from other parts of the state. Well, that can‚Äôt be true because the entire regular was against teams from multiple counties with different rules! Every. Single. Match. So they only care now that students have achieved something. Just so you understand how the rules are, my school made my shooting team wear masks while firing. Yes we were indoors but every shooter was just under 7 feet apart from each other so it was just a rule for the sake of rules. Even better, no other county had this rule. So, their reasoning is bullshit at worst and incredibly inconsistent at best. That is basically their covid motto. That and gross mismanagement and incompetence. 

This doesn‚Äôt just hurt our county either. They let us compete for a slot at state and only made this rule today. This means that other students that are allowed to go to state won‚Äôt go because our player beat them. This means that some kid who has worked his entire season for this is being denied entry because another student who worked just as hard was also denied entry. I was shooting for about 4 hours a week at minimum for the past 4-6 months trying to be the best I could, and I can‚Äôt fucking compete. What good are sports if the competition is taken away?

Two days ago, I had gone and locked myself in the restroom at home because I was crying and didn't want my parents to see. 

I ended up sitting on the ground trying to calm down. Then I looked up and saw a bottle of bleach.

I thought about opening it up, how the grooves of the cap would feel on my palm, how it would be hard to open because it was a bit old and hadn't been used much at all. Then the smell of bleach. Smelling nothing but bleach. The smell burning my nose. The smell clinging in my nostrils like a parasite. How I was my own parasite, leeching off myself, gaining nothing. 

Then the thought of getting my hands and knees from how I was sitting right at that moment, hooking my finger around the handle and dragging the bottle toward me. 

Then I snapped out of it and cried for a good while longer.

4565,"My friend is convinced suicide is the only solution.So my friend is still in her teens. She has been visiting a psychologist for theast year and they've talked about various schemas and issues. They've concluded most of her depression comes from her parents and her inability to live up to expectations. 

Before, it was just the pressure from her mum - saying stuff like, ""Why are you wearing that?"", ""Your skirt is too short."", ""You wouldn't have depression if youd just listen to me."", and just generally raising her voice and being as most typical Asian mothers are. I've seen her mother in action so its not just a biased comment from my friend. Her mother seems to be very demanded and having particular expectations about etiquette and academic performance. Her mother is also a very closed minded individual and doesn't like the fact that my friend discusses her thoughts and feelings with me.

And as of late, her father is siding with his wife, I'm assuming mostly due to the fact that he doesn't understand much about mental health and doesn't know what to do.

As a result, she feels like her parents are always against her and get upset that she can't live up to these set expectations to which she does try to meet. She has struggled with self harm before and has self esteem and self image issues. She has anxiety and depression and has shared she doesn't want to be around anymore, that she doesn't care, and that she feels lonely and empty.

I try to ask her questions about what she does want but even she doesn't know. She also feels even worse that she doesn't know and that she feels useless, and is convinced suicide is the only choice. She's still alive currently but I'm at a loss. While I can empathise with depression as I've gone through it myself, we're both fundamentally different people so what worked for me don't work for her. She also fears failure so she isn't motivated to try new things. 

The most I can do is listen and be there. But it breaks my heart to see her like this. Please help. ",suicide

It may be weird, but it sets my mind straight and helps me appreciate life. It also makes me fear most methods of suicide. But tonight, I've been struggling with an exam, and its the silliest reason, but it brought back all of my old thoughts and feelings. There is a lot in life to love, hobbies, SO's, family. But everything with me seems to fade away. 

My hobbies always change, and I can't stand the thought that history shows for me that in a few months I'll abandon my novel and move on to some other silly quest for success in a limitless field that is always just slightly too boring or difficult for my tastes. 

I've never had a girlfriend, I'm 22, never been kissed really, and day by day, my self-pity becomes self-loathing mixed with lies that I don't care anymore. I try to harden myself to what I am, someone who has had many chances to have a girlfriend or date a girl that liked me and that I liked as well. But those times were years ago, and now I am at a new school for just one semester before I graduate, and everyone has their own little clique and I just can't fit in. My friends are all moved away or stopped getting in touch with me. The only people I talk to is family really. I feel empty inside, and the only thing that keeps me sane is writing and reading, which as I already said, will probably cease to be a real hobby of mine in the near future.

I just can't stand living, right now. My cravings grow every second that I think about school or work or student loans. I want nothing more than to blow off this exam, buy some cough syrup and go to town on that shit. I don't even know why I like it. Last time I used it I drank 6 bottles, although I did throw up at the end, and blacked out for a few hours. It is literally just a way to make time disappear, and is not enjoyable in any way. It's just a habit that I've developed, with no real reason to it except I'm addicted. And the fact that I still get goosebumps from thinking about it kills me. I just want it all to be over with. I feel worthless and as if I am just another average person. I am a no name that will be lost in the pages of history as just another man that never did anything other than sit on my ass and read. God I hate myself.",suicide

4662,"I came back from the edge. I wanted to share what learned for anyone still out there.Over the last few months I got caught up in a bad situation - probably the worst I've been a part of. It was entirely caused by my own screw ups. It left me in gut-wrenching pain, in regret, in shame, guilt, humiliation. It ruined my life for the time. It ruined my repuatation. It took its toll on those around me. It will be a long, long time before I'm able to recover. And at a point, the pain of it all was so bad that I truly thought it would be better to leave everything behind. I imagined the relief I would feel if I wouldn't feel at all. And then I imagined the void of it all. That's the other side. There's no pain, but also no joy. There's nothing in that void. I came close to it, but got scared of jumping in. Because of the good things. Though at the time the bad things were overwhelming, I couldn't stand the thought of never having another good time again. And that's what kept me from jumping in. There's never another life. At some point, that void will come for me. I won't be able to stop it. But I want to be sure to have gotten every last drop of joy out of my life before it does.

I had my weight lifted off my shoulders lately. I feel better now than I have in a long while. So I wanted to share a few things that I've come away with, for anyone who needs to hear.

*I've been where you are. I came back. I didn't think it was possible for me to come back, but I did. It's possible for you to come back too.

*Admit it to yourself. Whatever it is that's buried inside that you don't want to hear. Admit it to yourself. Then admit it to someone you trust.

*Almost everyone wants to help you. Please just ask them. Please just ask them. Even the people you're scared of. Please just ask them for help. Ask me if you have to - I'm anonymous.

*Face your demons. They'll outrun you if you don't. Seriously, this is the big one. You must turn to face them. Don't make my mistake - don't wait to face them. Once you do, the sense of relief is greater than the sense of dread for consequences you'll face.

Right after my weight was lifted, I realized how much more I wanted to savor the good times. I started to write myself a note. I wanted something to remind me of the things I loved. But as I was thinking of the last piece, an interruption occured. I never finished the note, but I like the way it turned out:

I tried to kill myself when I was 11, 12, and 15. After a long struggle, I finally thought I was okay. But now everything has gone to hell, and all I'm thinking of is how my life isn't even worth living anymore. 

When I turned 18 I was homeless. My uncle kicked me out because I wouldn't agree to be his slave and do his school work for college for him. My friend and her family took me in. They've been so good to me....it felt SO GOOD to pretend I was apart of a normal family. But I got too comfortable. I tricked myself into believing that the arrangement was forever but it's quickly coming to an end. I've over stayed my welcome. I'm not wanted anymore. 


I have until the end of April to move out and I'm so so scared. I'm terrified of being alone. I have so little money. I just want to be apart of a family. But I can never have that. 

I posted an ad on Craigslist tonight desperately asking if someone could rent me a room to me for under 200, and I would  clean and cook to earn the rest of my keep. A couple guys messaged me, and it's clear what they want me to do. They want sex in exchange for the room. And I have to do it. I have to give one of them my body if  I don't want to be homeless again. 

I feel so hopeless. This isn't what I wanted with my life. I want to be a teacher! I want to travel to South Korea and teach English! I want to see the world and help kids! But I can't even figure out how to get my shit in order to sign up for classes. 

I want to learn how to drive! I hate having to rely on others to get me where I need to go. But I'm so terrified of getting behind the wheel, I can't even bring myself to take the written exam for a learners permit. 

I'm pathetic. It's really true. And I don't want to be a pathetic waste of space. I don't want to burden the world anymore. I don't want to let these men touch my body. But what else is there? 

I want to punish myself for being so worthless. I want to end it all to atone for wasting everyone's time and effort. It feels like there's nothing worth living for anymore, every dream I've had that had kept me going just seem impossible now.

I have friends who feel more distant by the day, I haven't had a date or any romantic interactions since November, I feel invisible and radioactive all at the same time.. 

I have been thinking a lot about killing myself.. I thought about it in the past when I was depressed, but lately I've been thinking heavily about details. How, when, best way to do it with least impact on my family. My folks know that I was struggling and wrestling with these thoughts, but I don't think they understand how serious they have become and how much I'm still thinking about it.

I'm 33 years old, single and so lonely I feel like dying would be less painful. I also feel trapped because I refuse to kill myself before my parents pass, sister and brother in law are busy with a family of their own and can forget more easily given time. I never considered myself that unlovable/undesirable, but within the last 6 months I have really become convinced that I am going to be this alone for the rest of my life, and I may just be way uglier inside and out than I initially thought.. These thoughts of realizing I may just be alone for the rest of my life, as well as knowing I won't go through with it until I know it will be as least impactful as possible, makes me feel more and more stuck in the idea.

As of writing, my sleep schedule has started to make me wake up at night and sleep through the entire day. I always drift off at around 3-6 AM and then wake up at 3-6PM at the earliest and latest. As a result, my routine I'm trying to get to is ripped apart because of it.

I've been administered around two sleeping pills every night multiple times but my body quickly adapts to it and puts up a tolerance to the sleeping pills after one or two nights when given a dosage, and one of my siblings are convinced I'm suffering from Insomnia. I'm convinced it's getting worse by each passing night.

I can barely be bothered to get myself up from bed now due to lack of motivation. I'm not good with arts, writing, or music anymore, and the games I once enjoyed playing I've now grown more distant with each passing day, losing more motivation by each one.

I have a feeling that I might lose so much motivation that one day when I go to sleep and wake up, I'll just go back to sleep again. And then the cycle will repeat itself.

School is not helping either; I can't cope with the online work given, especially since I only have one computer that is **not** used for playing games. As a result, I've given that up too.

4736,"People say that committing suicide is selfish. But isn't telling someone not to commit suicide just as selfish?I have been thinking seriously about suicide for a while now. The only reason I havent done it, the one reason that I might not, is because I don't want to hurt the people who love me.
I've had two people in my life commit suicide, a friend and an ex. Both affected me deeply even though one of them I barely spoke to anymore. 
I don't want to hurt the people I love by putting them through that. But I also don't know if I can stay alive for them. Its a handful of friends and family, and generally they don't have a lot of time for me. I'm not berating them for that at all, but staying alive for people that I only talk to/see every now and then is really hard work. I have severe depression, and am alone for maybe 80% of the time. Not for want of trying, they just have busy lives and i dont expect them to make time for me all of the time, I dont doubt that they love me.
So that is the only reason i have for not killing myself. Every day I struggle to find a reason to stay alive and that feeling is just awful. Every day I look up new ways of how to deal with this kind of suffocating depression and none of it works. I would be fully content to end my life if it wasnt for risk of hurting people. But thats a difficult thing to hold on to when every day hurts me so much. 
So i guess I just want to know why I should stay alive against my will. 
FYI I'm not looking for pity or anything like that, I'm genuinely curious to find out some reasons for living a life that I'm done with and opinions on why its OK to tell someone that suicide is not an option when it should be: my life, my body, my decision.

I'm 20 now, and I've been pretty much ok for the past year, but things get bad when I'm stressed or when situations like this occur.

Yesterday was the final exam for one of my easy introductory college classes. I woke up late and had to rush to make it to class on time. I realized I forgot my wallet so I didn't have any ID, but this professor has never required ID for any test before so I figured it was ok. I only have a pencil and my cell phone with me. Well, it wasn't ok and she required ID for the final. I handed in my test and explained to her that I forgot my wallet and I'm very sorry but I don't have any ID. She was pissed and said ""why would you do, how stupid are you?"" and continued to yell at me saying ""you always need to show ID for finals, haven't you ever been to school before?"". This went on for 5 minutes with her yelling and sighing and saying there was nothing she could do, before she told me it was ok and let me hand in the test.

To make matters worse, I missed one of the tests for this class (do to an anxiety attack). The final grade takes into account only 3 of the 4 tests taken in the semester. I thought it would be ok if I only took 3 tests but now I'm not so sure. This was pretty stupid on my part, but if it's not ok and she counts the zero I'm pretty much screwed because I can't go to talk to her after yesterday.

I don't know how to deal with this. I've always been a top student, I have a 94 average in this class and a 3.8 GPA. I have never been yelled at like that before and it has me really shaken up.

4751,"(17) Please tell me it gets better after high school. I have a rope sitting in my Amazon cart.I've suffered from this long enough to know that suicidal thoughts are fleeting.

Yet, they keep coming back. Too often. I tell myself that I've grown stronger since then, but the events in my life seem to be worsening. In the past 7 days, I got rejected from a full-ride scholarship that would allow me to pursue my educational dreams. I poured my heart and soul into that application, only to find out that even beyond my stats, my story and hard work just weren't good enough. I also found out that my ex cheated on me for an entire year; they're all laughing at me on social media now. My grades are declining. Straight A student for 11 years...now a chronic C student. 

I find myself, once again, curled up in the corner of my room drenching my t-shirt in tears and snot. 

My mind is currently consumed with the thoughts of, ""What did I do wrong? What am I worth? Am I too ugly, just like I had always thought? Why did I not connect the yeast infections and UTIs to my partner's disloyalty? Can I trust anyone anymore? How will I go into my next relationship without insecurities?"" 

I've reached out to so many caring friends, but I know I'm burdening them with my issues. Seeking professional help is not an option at the moment, as my parents believe that mental health issues do not exist. They are genocide survivors, and they'd tell me, ""How can you be so frail while living a cushioned life?"" I feel guilty. Disappointed. Numb. Confused. Selfish.

But most of all, I am tired. I need a long, long rest. I recently read a post somewhere about how sleep is just a free trial of death. Sounds good to me. 

I pride myself on developing my own coping mechanisms, but are they really working if I continue to revisit that corner in my room?",suicide

I'm in the depths of a depressive episode and was inches away from committing suicide last night. I had my pills ready, I'd written my will, I'd come to peace with it. I was almost miraculously saved by a friend who was concerned by a conversation we'd had that evening and saw me, spoke to me, listened to me, in the middle of the night despite her having to go work the next morning. She's given so much of her time and help and I am incredibly thankful and lucky to have her. She's offered to speak to my parents about this (I don't currently feel like I can), she's looked up safe place I could stay in my city, charity counselling services, offered to call them up for me.

But because my brain is a piece of s*** I don't want help from any of the services she's mentioned. I don't want my parents to know, I don't want to speak to mental health volunteers, I don't want to stay in a safe place for suicidal people. I don't fucking know why. Maybe I don't believe they'll help, maybe I don't want to accept that they'd help. But I do want help. I'd give anything to feel differently. To feel hope. It's a complete contradiction and I feel horrible about it. And mostly I don't know what to do. I just want a doctor to fix me. It's like I don't have the energy to put any effort in my own recovery.

I've dug and dug and still not found. So I pray. I need a miracle. I have to break free.

4761,"insensitive to things you don't understandBefore I begin, I can't speak on behalf of my entire community. I'm also not the best at typing out complete thoughts.
I'm a transgender male. I have crippling dysphoria. Not everyone's dysphoria is at the same level as mine, but every transgender person deserves the same respect towards their identity.
I don't consider myself mentally ill by having my condition. I have depression and anxiety that stem from my condition, but being transgender isn't a ""mental illness"" and if anything it's a medical condition that needs treatment, which would be hormone replacement and surgery without it being considered cosmetic choices. Some transgender people are mentally ill for other reasons, and they still deserve the same respect. 

Here's why I'm putting this here. I am so uncomfortable in my body. Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and want to slit my throat because I don't have an Adam's apple like my dad, and that's no where near the worst of what I deal with on a daily basis. I literally want to kill myself because I'm not who I'm supposed to be. There are so many people like me and people still want to dismiss it as us being delusional, disgusting, mentally ill humans who need therapy to be comfortable with ""who we are already"". The thing is, that doesn't work. Nothing is going to stop how we feel. 
Why not accept us transitioning to help us feel just a bit more comfortable with ourselves? What do you possibly get from refusing to respect someone's pronouns, making fun of someone's plastic surgery, calling a transwoman a man in a dress? Why is another human's pain and struggles funny to you? Because you're dehumanizing us for it and trivializing our struggles because you can't even begin to know and realize how it feels. So many trans youth are killing themselves because their parents don't accept them and today's society doesn't treat them seriously. It makes us feel sometimes that we don't have a future. I watch gay marriage become legal where I live and I'm glad, but I still see transpeople, especially trans women of color, get murdered and I see people calling Caitlyn Jenner a freak and I just don't understand. What does it matter to you. How is our life affecting you? I'd rather be dead sometimes than think about how many people think I'm disgusting scum of the earth for reasons that don't affect them in any way. When you can sit back and realize how different society is to people like me, you will understand why people like Caitlyn Jenner and the entirety of the transgender and LGBT community as a whole ARE brave for coming out. It's sad that to live our lives comfortably other people seek to make them even harder for no reason. I want transgender people, especially the young ones who aren't getting the chance to live freely, to stop having to kill themselves because they aren't getting the attention, love, and treatment they need. It makes me sick. As bad as I want to kill myself sometimes, I want to be here for others who are dealing with the same thing and sometimes that's the only thing keeping me going.",suicide

I really really tried to tell myself i didn't like her. But being honest i guess i liked her.

I imagined being with her. Not in a creepy way. I just tend to imagine situations. How it'd be going out with my friends and having a good time, hugging everyone i respect and ""love"", i imagine myself doing stuff I'd never be able to do, or saying stuff I'd never be able to say.

We kind of were friends (not bug friends, just... ""friends""). *Were* because thanks to quarantine I lost any chance of getting to know some beautiful people i met not long ago, her included. Those friendly relationships abruptly stopped because of covid. 

I've recorded an audio-testament (is that an ok term?) and she was one of the ppl outside of my family i spent most time giving a personal message wishing her the best. 

It's stupid. I know. I just... Never stood a chance. I've never had a girlfriend (I'm 20yo) so I've got no experience. I've liked a girl just twice. Just two times I've feel I'm in love with someone.

4784,"The Self Defeating LoopI'm sorry ahead of time if this is long, but my thoughts are jumbled and I need to get them out somehow. I also feel like history is sort of an important piece to the puzzle so I want to get that out of the way.

I'm a 34 year old transgender woman living in California under someones' hospitality. I've been a constant drain on financials, and though I help with chores and whatever else needs doing, I constantly feel as though I've created a situation for myself in which I can't really escape from. I want to help, I want to clean myself up, get a job, contribute and support the people closest to me. But any time I try I always seem to sabotage any sort of positivity or progress that I've made, there's always this darkness on the periphery of all my actions that sort of just eats away at any attempt at forward momentum that I make. 

The shitty thing is, I moved out here initially to make that positive change, to get HRT, to train myself for a career, to have and be part of a support network of a bunch of other queer people. But instead I've wasted every opportunity that I've been given, I strained a relationship with someone to the point that we don't talk anymore, I stressed myself out learning new skills, and when I started taking HRT I got depressed and stopped. And this isn't the first time that this has happened, it's like a constant cycle of like ""I'm going to help myself"" followed shortly by me sabotaging every single thing that I try to do to the point that I get more and more depressed and the world loses more and more color.

I considered committing suicide once before, the darkest my world ever seemed to get. I've known I was trans since I was 15, but due to a conservative family and the constant fear of outing myself I kept it pushed down in myself for the longest time. Once or twice I tried to vocalize that I was trans to my parents but I was always gas-lighted with ""Oh this is just a phase."" or ""Everyone has these sorts of feelings from time to time."" I hated, and continue to hate myself so much. I never felt like I fit in with anybody, and that sort of crept into my school life, and when I (barely) graduated from high school it crept further into my adult life. So much that I constantly had trouble holding down jobs, I would spend all of my time alone in my room distracting myself with the internet and video games, I wouldn't take showers or take care of myself at all. I didn't feel like there was a point to any of it, because even if I did do all that stuff I still wouldn't feel like I was myself, like I fit in with other people. It all culminated to a point where I was on the brink of being homeless during a particularly bad Midwestern winter, unable to feed myself, having lost a job a month before and having told no one and I thought to myself: ""What if I just slit my wrists.""

And the thing was I had entertained thoughts like that before but at that time the thought was so strong and like, such a good answer in my mind for everything that was happening that I honestly scared myself. I felt like ""Oh god, I'm actually going to slit my wrists if I don't talk to someone.""

So I talked to my mom. During the time that my life was unraveling my parents seemed to chill out a lot. Believe it or not a concussion caused my dad to change his whole political ideals to much more liberal, and my mom started working on a college campus so she started to get more liberal as well. It was lucky for me that their shift in personality happened when it did because they got me out of that bad situation, I was brought home and they watched over me and made sure I didn't do anything to myself. They constantly told me they loved me, and they listened to my problems, and it was honestly the first time in my life that my parents had ever done anything that made me feel accepted by them.

I was finally able to confront my gender issues, I started socializing with people, and I started building a support network again. Hence me moving to California. As I mentioned before that has sort of all gone to pot. I don't ever want to blame someone else for my problems but, the person that I got into a relationship with sort of led me in this direction. Everything was fine at first, they were helping me and I was happy to be with them, but they also had all their own issues with narcissist parents; and they seemed to constantly push me away because I couldn't really understand the issues that they were having, despite me trying to be supportive. Not only that but I'm sort of an introvert and they're an absolute extrovert, so like they would go off on these grand adventures and do these things that made me feel unsafe.

For instance they liked to go hiking, which I would have liked to do, but I found out the kind of hiking they liked to do was go off the beaten path and climb up the sides of hills or across rock faces. I'm not really that physically capable plus I'm pretty tall, so while going up hills and stuff was easy enough every time I went down a hill I felt like I was going to topple over and fall down the hill, and honestly it scared the shit out of me. Also I'm claustrophobic and they liked to explore sea caves on the beach, there was one time they climbed into this small hole in the rocks and expected me to follow. I broke down crying because I didn't want to go in there, and they just laughed at me; the only reason I even went into the cave was because they bumped their head and said they started bleeding, so my worry for them won over the fear I had for the cave.

It's just like, wherever they went I couldn't really follow, and they would constantly push me away as a result of that. They would travel cross country in their car and leave me alone for weeks to months so they could go talk to some conversion camp survivor in Wichita or something. It just felt like they gave up on me and as a result I sort of gave up on them and everything else over time. And I think I sort of told myself that was just par for the course, after all I could never keep a job, I couldn't make school work, I couldn't make anything in my life really work for me, so why should a relationship be any different.

Like maybe I was asking too much out of the relationship, maybe that sort of support where someone helps you or teaches you just doesn't really exist. Maybe everyone is just dealing with their own problems, and me having my own problems is just adding to their own piles when I ask for help with something.

I keep dropping anything that I pick up, it all just feels useless, it feels like I'm applying paint to a ramshackle hut on the side of a highway. I start running or exercise and stop every couple of months, I start HRT and stop every couple of months, I try learning a new skill and stop every couple of months. No matter what I do I just can't seem to build up the momentum to keep going. Like I know that the world isn't going to hand me anything on a platter, I know I have to work for the things that I want, and I theoretically have no problem with doing the work; except that I do seem to have a problem with it. 

I mean I guess the **tl;dr** of that is that I just feel like everything is useless, I feel like no matter what I do I'm constantly in this loop of feeling motivated and then having that motivation just sucked away. I feel like I'm pathetic, a drain on others, and just entirely not worth anyone's effort much less my own. And at the end of the day I don't really know what to do about it. Just like everything else I've tried to talk to therapists, multiple times, but for whatever reason I end up missing a session or two then I just stop talking to them entirely, and I know in my heart that this is just going to happen again if I try to get myself some help.

Lately it's gotten to the point where I've been thinking about just ending it. I want to break the cycle and it seems like the only option I have to do it is to end everything.",suicide

*I had been on Prozac (8 months) and then changed to Cymbalta (took that for about 3 months) and I just weened off about 30 days ago.

All I ever wanted was to have a family and settle down, but it didn't happen. I try to do other things, but they don't make me happy because it's not what I wanted. I'm halfway through a PhD because learning was just something to fill the time. I hate it. There's no point doing anything else because it won't make life worth it. 

Found out in January that I can't have kids. That means I can NEVER have the life I wanted. I'm alone, sick and deep in debt from the PhD so adopting ISN'T the option people keep telling me it is - like it's SO easy and SO obvious. 

All anyone says is THERE'S PLENTY OF TIIIIIIME!!!!! YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIIIIIFFE! And I'm sick of it. Time has run out for me. I'm only going to get more sick. I've ended treatment because I don't want to prolong my life - I doubt it will kill me, but I don't want to drag it out. 

Suicide is ideal for me. No more pain. No more sickness. No more debt. No family to leave behind. No partner. No friends. Last time I was in hospital I was gone 4 days and nobody noticed. I've tried reaching out but nobody listens. They have partners and families and don't give a shit about those of us that weren't good enough.

I ended up putting on my fake practiced customer service face and made it through the work day. Then I got home and it got worse. I went to pay a couple bills, and the first thing I see before paying any bills is that my credit card is over drawn by a couple hundred dollars. Between having to make a payment on my card, and the bill I was actually going to pay, I'm completely out of money. I just got paid, I don't get paid for two weeks, and I will be out of town for a work trip on pay day without direct deposit, so I'm completely broke, have bills that are due before my next pay check, and my next pay check will get to me late.

My credit card has been a blessing and a curse for me. The only reason I'm under a mountain of credit card debt is because I was in a bad place and needed to use it or not have a place to live or food. I'm glad I had it when I needed it, but it's so impossible to get out from under. 

I don't know how I'm going to survive the next two weeks. I'm at the lowest point I've been at in a very long time. I know everyone has money issues, and no one wants to hear about mine. I can only take so much for so long. I've been under crippling debt for over a decade now. Every time I start to get under it something else comes up. I'll start getting my bills down a bit then my car dies. Oh, there goes another couple thousand. A family member dies, and I get some inheritance, I can make a huge payment towards getting out of debt. Oh, my car dies again. All of that money I got goes to buying a replacement.

4805,"When I lost my mindI have created a throw-away account just so I don't get tarnished on my other one. I'm a frequent visitor here although it has been a while since I last visited. 


I think I've lost my mind. Now I truly know the meaning of the word. Genuinely, I think my mind is now lost forever. I used to be suicidal. I wouldn't do too much. But I was attempting mildly about once every few months. I have minimal scarring due to my method of choice.

Anyways, about 9 months ago something deep within me clicked. Suddenly, I was happy and active. I was diagnosed Bi-Polar. I was working around until 3 am every night. I was working one full time job, part time classes, and I was doing extra-curricular work all the time. I was extremely happy, but in an unhealthy way.

After about 3 months of super energized bliss, the light didn't shut off.. it kind of... burned low. Now, like an ember in a bulb, it radiates a general content with life. What some people might call ""happy"". However, along with it is the ashes of my previous depression. 20 long years of constant suicidal thoughts perverted my mind. I was a sociopath by many accounts. Though sensibly ethical and occasionally expressive, I was always subtly empty. That emptiness carried over after my sudden bout of happiness. Now, I'm content, but empty...

I feel like a shell. I have goals and aspirations now. I have dreams and hopes. But I can't *feel* anything. Its like instead of being suicidal and having a deep fulfilling desire for suicide, I'm now just me. Just a sociopath trying his best. 

I don't feel like I'm ""me"" anymore. I feel like a robot. I walk into the office, I make jokes, I talk to friends and family, I'm pursuing other things, but all the while I feel like a robot. Literally...    *emotions DELETED*.  

I guess depression was the one thing that made me feel... human. It was the occasional despair that tied me to this Earth. Now, I feel beyond it. If I was fired today, I would feel nothing. If someone hated me deeply, nothing. Now, instead of falling deeper into sadness, I feel nothing. 

It sometimes makes me want to murder or steal. Just to feel that rush of guilt and despair as my life falls apart. But I'm much too ethical to abuse another life just for my own. Sometimes - though - I fantasize about the court room. About the jail time. How I'd ache to be free again, ache for **something**. 

My only driving force is to educate myself further and further until I've conquered the educational world. Until I've learned physics and math to a level that I consider prideful. 

So, essentially, I feel weightless and empty now. Like I'm floating around the world. I have nothing to ground me. Does anyone else feel this way?",suicide

And as far as I can remember I've never wanted to be here.
My childhood was full of domestic violence and drug abuse.
And I've never felt truly loved or cared for
But I'm a coward
When I was 9 I would go to the kitchen everynight and hold a blade to my wrist
Crying because I couldn't cut myself.
Crying because I want to die
Over the years as growing to an adult I have experienced nothing but turmoil and shame 
I try to be a good person and am never foul to another soul
And recently I aquired something real in my life 
And I love her so much
But things quickly changed 
She's stuck on her abusive ex

The thing is I've never felt this way about anyone 
I've always had to force myself to love people 
But with her it's different
I didn't have to force anything 
I got to be me with her
Told her more about myself than I've ever told anyone 

But I don't have her anymore

I've numbed that

Not tldr - So, for most of my life, I‚Äôve lived in a two family house, which is split with two floors. Each floor 3 bed 1 bath. So me, my mom, my dad, my sister, and my two dogs got the upstairs, and my dads parents got the downstairs. From 5th grade to most of 8th grade (corona messed it up) my grandpa took me to school almost every day, 8th grade it became every other day when I started taking the bus. We love each other to death, I carry his middle name. And hey, we‚Äôre Hispanic, so we‚Äôre pretty darn close. So the people we knew next door moved and wanted us to take the house. So we did, but that left the upstairs vacant. So my parents wanted to rent it to someone. They were gonna pick this marine that was staying here for a bit, but gave it to a family near us who‚Äôs house burned down. So they come in, we‚Äôre next door, snazzy. So since I‚Äôm next door and now in high school all honors classes, I come over a lot less, I‚Äôve been trying as hard as possible to visit and I can always only squeeze in an hour, I wish I had more time, but mostly I don‚Äôt.

its a pretty mix-matched group, two of the kids are pretty popular and have lots of friends, the other two are kind of nerdy/geeky, but we still all have fun when we hangout despite our differences.

im somewhere in between. id consider myself pretty smart and love learning and stuff, but i guess i can come off as a cool or chill dude too. i crack jokes with popular kids, and can have ‚Äúsmart‚Äù conversations with the not so popular kids. im nice to everyone, i don‚Äôt care where you lie in the social ranking, as long ass you aren‚Äôt a dick to me.

for the most part tho, i tend not to be friends with popular kids as most of them are douchebags and im really shy anyway. i usually talk to this one group of stoners, as they aren‚Äôt really popular, but definitely aren‚Äôt nerdy either.

im kind of rambling at this point, but what im trying to say is pretty much that i feel like im too ‚Äúcool‚Äù for the nerdy kids, they dislike me because i hangout with people that they don‚Äôt like, and make the assumption that im douchy as well, and i don‚Äôt fit in with the cool kids either, as im too awkward and nerdy and don‚Äôt make fun of other kids with them. the way i see the groups at my school would be: the stick up rich kids who are just complete assholes to everyone for no reason, and the extremely overly nerdy/weird no-it-all kids (no offense to them, i don‚Äôt dislike them BECAUSE they are nerdy, we just tend to not have compatible personality‚Äôs,  and can‚Äôt bond over anything)

i just feel like i don‚Äôt belong anywhere. im an outcast. no one has the same humor as me, besides my friend in California that ive known my whole life. he‚Äôs the closest friend i have, and he‚Äôs the only friend i have that i can just be my complete self too. but he‚Äôs on the other side of the US, i moved to Florida a few years ago. we still communicate often by playing video games together. i wish i knew kids over here in Florida with the same type of personality and passions that we do.

4844,"Suicide and Global Warming.Ok. So I've been reading up on climate change and global warming, and needless to say, I am absolutely scared shitless. For those not in the know, current climate change models and predictions show our world becoming a much much much much worse place in the near and distant future. I'm at the point where I'm starting to think none of us have a very happy future ahead of us. And our children and grandchildren will be even worse off. So, in my fit of despair and panic, I got to thinking, and I came to the conclusion that if I'm not already dead by the time climate change starts getting really bad, I'm going to kill myself. Current projects say we have been 30 and 50 years of relatively normal weather and stuff until things start getting bad (I.E. superstorms, droughts, famines, floods, sea level rise, overpopulation, mass displacement and immigration the likes of which we have never seen) I can't see myself wanting to live in a world like that, and I certainly wouldn't want my children to live in a world which I knew was going to be worse for them than the world I was born into. So my view on global warming is that its only a matter of time before disasters begin to strike, and we enter into a new era of hopelessness. I'm 19 now, so I got a few safe decades to live. I for one want things to end on a high note, so if i have to end things myself, then so be it. ",suicide

4855,"Told Everyone I Want to Die; Still Want to DieIt just came spilling out of me one night when talking to my mom. Then I stumbled into telling an empathetic acquaintance when I asked her for advice on something over drinks. A few days later, during an anxiety attack, a friend messaged me and I impulsively told her that I've been suicidal for the past year and that I was having a mental breakdown. 

And now I'm telling you, internet stranger.

I'm not sure what I expected to get out of telling people. I guess I was looking for some reason to live to just hit me, but it hasn't. 

Now I just feel more trapped than ever. 

If I kill myself now, I'm going to cause any immense amount of pain and guilt. My death wouldn't have been painless for my parents anyway, which is why I've forced myself to live for so long, but now I would be a complete fucking asshole for killing myself after I told them. 

I think the problem is that I now feel obligated to improve, and I don't know how to do that. I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now. Changed therapists 3 times now (insurance issues, long story).  The drugs don't work though. And as for the therapy - the simple fact is that you can't decide for someone that their life is worth living. 

I have been suicidal many times over my life, but they were at emotional crisis points when I hated myself. I don't necessarily hate myself now. I just haven't thought life was worth living for a year now and I still don't. Food is unappetizing. Nothing is funny anymore. I don't get joy from anything.

Tomorrow will be 3 months since we buried our 17 year old son. He was the second of 5 children. He suffered from depression and anxiety, had had multiple hospitalizations, meds and doctors. We would have done anything he needed. In the months that have passed, our family has suffered more than anyone could fathom. My children cry themselves to sleep plenty of nights. My husband is a walking zombie. I cry around the clock and cannot function. I don‚Äôt judge a single one of you. I love you all and wish I could take your pain. But try....really truly try. Tell your parents, your loved ones and if they don‚Äôt help, keep trying. You have a purpose. What you may ask? To light the candle for others suffering. So they know they are not alone, not to blame for how they feel and that someday we will find a cure. You are NOT your depression. That is a separate beast that is stealing who you truly are. It isn‚Äôt different from cancer. Treatments are weak at this point, but we are all trying and fighting for you all. So no, don‚Äôt listen to depression telling you that you are a burden. No one is better off without your light. The world will forever change without your path. Yes, these are dark times, but suicide submerges All who love you (and although you don‚Äôt think so - again depression is tricking you) will suffer. And they will suffer for an eternity. But they won‚Äôt have a way out because they will see and experience the aftermath. I have mixed feelings about this forum. Some messages are loving, others are speaking via depression. I wish you spent a day with a survivor so that you saw the pain and suffering. And that it would allow you to understand that depression is your enemy. It‚Äôs tricking you and stealing you. But it is not you. Love you all. Tomorrow, 3 months out will be another day of hell while we battle our guilt, despair, failure, self hatred and pain of missing our son. That is the aftermath of a suicide. Every single one. I am a mother of an angel. Please try again today to find the strength to fight, if not for yourself - for the community of mothers, fathers, siblings, friends, grandparents, children and everyone who will never forgive themselves no matter what you write in a note. You cannot sum up a lifetime in these notes. You cannot understand that you were loved from the second you arrived with a love from so many that you are unaware would have taken your place to have you back here in an instant. ",suicide

- Wearing a mask and social distancing is a small price to pay for things to go back to normal -

Until a couple of weeks ago, I was an anti-masker. I live in Florida, and work in a restaurant; and it was only until masks became mandatory in my restaurant, after months of not wearing one, that I came around and understood the importance of wearing a mask. My excuses were that it is hot. I am constantly running around and wearing a mask, I thought, would slow me down and make me uncomfortable. The funny thing is, I‚Äôd never actually worn a mask before so I had no real knowledge of what wearing it would feel like. Let me tell you all, ITS NOT THAT BAD. Sure you might get a LITTLE warmer than you would if you weren‚Äôt wearing it, but that is a reasonable price to pay for preserving the safety and lives of others. I have taken a complete 180 on this issue and feel guilty for my stance before. Let me be clear. A mask does not make you immune to coronavirus. I work in an overcrowded restaurant, and even after wearing a mask every second at work, i still tested positive for coronavirus a few days ago. Social interaction is the worst possible thing we could be doing right now and I am quarantined in my house with a lot of things to think about. How my comfort used to overrule others‚Äô safety. How I used to hate people pushing for masks, how annoying it was, and now how important it is. If anyone reading this would just take a minute to examine what makes their life more important than anyone else‚Äôs, I think we would have a lot more lives saved. A mask doesn‚Äôt make you immune, but it does help. And refusing to wear one, going out partying, and not social distancing is a selfish and deadly exercise to partake in.

I'm trapped in these hours again and again, and the seasons change and showers fall and droughts come about and there I am still watching with blank mind. I am lost in time it seems. 

I don't know how to get out. I think there's no way. I live my life and try my damndest and there I am back where I started. There was sense it all meant something at some time or another, and that in the future I'd win the day and it'd be clear that I was made all behovely for this world. 

Instead, tomorrow will be like yesterday and people will talk to me in their dull loops and it'll be like sitting before an awful movie. All the sundry parts don't add up to anything, it's all just noise in sequence, static trying to speak to me, the garbled crunches holding nothing in them but randomness. 

I am at the end of my rope, not because I'm in great pain or suffering great sickness, but because hope seems so silly about now.

I feel like I'm divided into two parts, one that wants to survive and be helped, and one that doesn't think I even deserve getting another shot. Right now the larger part of me wants to die. Badly. So fucking badly. It knows I cannot fix or even outweigh my mistakes.

But the existence of the smaller part, the part that is saying ""no, there is a reason you were once loved, there is a person inside of you that you once were, even if she's gone you can make her again"". That's the part that bought the journal. The part that scheduled a therapist appointment.

The time it starts, people aren‚Äôt ready to learn until 10:30 am. Not 8:30 or before. So schools open at 9:00 and start at 10:00. Ends at 3:25, with no homework.

Standardized tests are now banned, they put too much stress on people and the only tests that will stay are the SAT and ACT, for college purposes.

The only required class would be Math as is used in every job. Every other class is optional and classes would last for 45 minutes each. You need 5 classes.

More language options instead of just French and Spanish, as more people have interests in different countries.

More creative based classes and classes explaining how technology works and how to fix it.",non-suicide
4910,"All bad choicesI know my situation isn't as bad as other's, but I'm just fucking miserable. I told myself that when I left high school I would start uni to pursue a legal career, then I got cold feet at the last minute and did nothing. That was the worst year of my life, working 2 shifty jobs that didn't respect me, one with a manager that didn't value the work I put in and another that sexually assaulted me. I took a year to work and save but all I did was work for 3 months and left never wanting to work a job again. I spent months laying inside just rotting.

Then something happened, I got some energy back, I decided I wanted to continue the legal career idea but at a smaller level, but I just did it all over again. At the last minute I got cold feet and chose no. Then a friend suggest I swap enrollment to something else and use that explore. 

I hate it. I'm 2 weeks behind because of my cold feet, I hate every piece of work in the course, and it's too late to refund the tuition I put down. I'm stuck here being miserable and I'm back to wanting to kill myself again. Why do I always dig my own pit?",suicide

4912,"Having a hard time finding a reason to keep goingI‚Äôve been living in Oakland on and off the last few years. I moved into my current place last October, and I‚Äôve experienced nothing but bad luck since. First month I had my car broken in to, and the battery stolen. Okay at least I got the car back in February after all repairs. I met someone that same month, and was very much into her. In the time we were together she lost her very awesome job and her very nice house. I stuck by her through it because I cared about her, and knew she needed some kind of support. 

In this time I also lost my cat, and our family dog. Comparatively they are not equal I suppose but still very difficult situations to deal with. 

Things between me and this person I was seeing started to go bad. When I brought up things that made me upset or uncomfortable to her she would turn it around to invalidate my feelings. It was like any issues I had with her were my problem because it‚Äôs my feelings that were hurt. Taking zero responsibility for her actions. She would also say our relationship had nothing but tragedy in it even though she was dealing with most of the bad situations. I did nothing but support her through it, so I felt incredibly hurt when she said that. It didn‚Äôt feel great to have to cut the relationship. When things were good between us it was good but the times she made me cry were not easy to forget. We broke up two days ago.

Yesterday was the cherry on top of my frustrations; I went out to my car so I could buy groceries, and I discovered my car was missing. After filing a police report my car was found behind a gas station completely torn apart on the inside. Also the battery was stolen again. This time though because they hot wired the car it completely destroyed any chance for repairs. The ignition was gutted, and I couldn‚Äôt even put the car in neutral. So now my only car I‚Äôve ever owned sits in a car lot waiting to see if it‚Äôs even worth the trouble. 

I‚Äôm so frustrated with how my life is going. No car or partner anymore. My roommate might as well not exist because he is gone for months at a time. While I do enjoy having the apartment to myself I am alone without a close friend. We‚Äôve been friends since high school so I actually know the guy. 

I have a decent job at least but now without my car I‚Äôm going to have major financial struggles with transportation. My job starts at 5 AM but the train doesn‚Äôt start until that time. So now if I want to be on time I‚Äôll have to take ride shares which are not cheap. I don‚Äôt make a lot of money so this is definitely going to be an issue.

I feel like some cruel invisible force is choking me, and laughing at my pain. Like someone is saying ‚Äúhere, take a small piece of something good. Now that you‚Äôve had your spoonful, have a heaping bag of shit so you‚Äôre reminded how things actually are.‚Äù 

I‚Äôd be a lot happier if I died in my sleep. Dealing with these awful people who keep fucking with my car isn‚Äôt worth it. Paying a ridiculous amount of money for a shitty apartment isn‚Äôt worth it. Living in the bay area will probably kill me. I have no options. I feel so powerless.",suicide

On his drawer I caught a glimpse of a note with my name and my sisters written on the top. I read a bit and the first line was ""if you are reading this I am dead"". I couldn't read any further and ran out. I know my dad has been severely depressed. He lost the love of his life; my stepmother last October. It was sudden, she had health issues but we thought she'd have more time. They got married only 3 months before. It's not something I'd wish on anyone, to see the person they loved for over 15 years die so suddenly. 
I'm currently shaking and searching as to what to do. I can't bring it up to him. Every time I've mentioned his depression or what happened he shuts me out instantly. He's told me to leave when I tried to get him some help. I knew it was bad but I didn't think I'd see that. Does anyone have any ideas? I'm completely lost, I'm so scared of what he has planned. He told me recently that he's purchased a passport and was going, in his words, ""somewhere, anywhere, not sure"". After seeing this now I fear the worst.

4936,"I'm really not sure what I'm going to do.I'm 23 years old. I've had issues with self harm since I was 11, depression since 14, anxiety since 15. I've long been called paranoid, but started noticing serious paranoia in the last six months or so. I've been in a bad mental state since about November.

It doesn't help that I've just graduated, thus losing a job and moving away from most of my friends and my ex. It doesn't help that I'm living with my parents and have been unable to house or feed myself, much less find a job or a place of my own. It doesn't help that my ex and I broke up about a week and a half ago. But none of these are the reason I'm depressed or suicidal.

I've never seriously attempted suicide, but feeling suicidal is unfortunately very familiar to me. I have done reckless things that had the potential to kill me several times, knowing I could die and not caring whether I did or not. (It is mostly luck that I am still here.) I know that I'm not just going to get better from this and go on to live a normal, healthy, happy life. I know that it's possible -- probable, even -- that I will commit suicide. I don't believe I will live to see 25. 

I'm not ready to die, I don't really want to die. I'm too sad and too scared to go into nothingness alone. It would hurt my family too much if I died. But I feel like suicide is something I should do, whether I want to or not. I feel like it is inevitable. 

I want to get better, be happy, succeed at something. Or I want to want to. But I don't believe it's possible.

I saw a psychologist today, and felt marginally better. I have appointments with her on Monday and Thursday, and an appointment with a psychiatrist on Friday. 

I have no intention of acting any time soon, and it would take more effort to prepare things than I currently have anyway. I really don't want to die. But I also know that I have had at least one plan and the means to carry it out for years now. I know that I have had pretty much the same suicide note planned out for years, and used to carry it in my wallet. I know I meet an awful lot of the warning signs.

Sometimes, the thought of death comforts me. Mostly it scares me. I go back and forth on whether I really want to die, even though I know I don't have the guts to do it. Sometimes I can distract myself for a while and even laugh, or make abstract plans about the future (e.g. wanting to grow my hair long, or learn vegetarian cooking). That seems really weird to me, and it's distressing sometimes that I can go back and forth between happiness/hope (even if they're false) and despair so quickly and frequently. But I can't really ever forget or deny that I am seriously ill and have been for a long time, and that I probably always will be.

I don't even know what I'm trying to achieve by writing this. I guess I just want to talk. It seems like I'm all over the place this last month or so, and often forgetful.",suicide

For a lot of reasons, I took a fairly large amount of benzos and alcohol last night - something i've been considering doing for a while - kind of expecting that I'd feel some sort of shock or panic after doing so as it was more than enough to be considered fatal. Basically I just felt numb at the time and in the end I just slept for about 16 hours and woke up feeling really dozy, unusual and a bit disappointed. 

Thing is, I could have taken more if I wanted to be absolutely certain that I'd die, but I was was equally quite annoyed that I didn't. I think perhaps the problem is that my life isn't terrible, other than some intolerable, progressively worsening medical conditions that I have. In fact, that's what's worse - all my friends &amp; family are progressing their lives and mine has been getting worse and more painful by the day for two years. I'm 25 can't stand to see everything I had slipping away, it's almost worse than the pain itself. I'm almost at the stage now where I can't walk properly and have constant nerve pain, having previously been very sporty and sociable etc etc.

5003,"I have no good reason to feel like this, and my personality makes it difficult to reach out.My head is a mess and this is sure to be a rambling pile of garbage. I never talk to anyone about my problems and just posting something like this is extremely uncomfortable for me.  I am sure I will rethink my decision to make this post and delete it but I havent been able to find any help yet.  I figure if there is anything I have learned from 10 years on reddit, its that they have a help area for everything.  Sure enough when I did a search here you guys are.

Quick rundown on me.  I am middle aged, married, with kids, and successful. 

I dont remember what it feels like to be happy, I cant recall the last time I felt any kind of joy.  I have become really good at faking it around friends and family.  Just flip a switch in my head when its time to be social act happy, make jokes, play my part make sure my sadness does not leak out and spoil the day for anyone else.  Its exhausting, sometimes for work I have to smile and keep my shit together for 12+ hours straight.  Im the nice guy that everyone depends on to get things done, Im the nice guy that everyone looks to for support and advise. Im the nice guy that is so exhausted from faking it all day long I have to sit in my car breaking down to the point that I get physically ill and have to throw up......then I have to flip that switch again because its time to go home and pretend everything is fine.

I get the feeling that everyone around me is jealous. My family is a dream, my wife is beautiful my kids are all amazing, I have a large home, I drive nice cars, I make a good living for the area I live in.  To me it all feels like a costume covering up reality.

I feel like I have failed my oldest child, she is about to be an adult and I know she resents me.  I try to force myself to be more involved but its exhausting and I do try my best to shield her from my bullshit.  I have some younger kids that I also feel like I am failing.  I cant seem to give them all the attention they deserve and I feel like they hate me for it.  I have heard them talking to eachother and night about me and it just crushed what little of my soul is left.

I think my wife is planning to leave me.  She has told me for years that she felt trapped and she needed some independence.  I did my best to support her in starting a new business, and its finally working out for her and going well.  I always thought that would make things better but instead that unease has festered and grown stronger.  I can feel it, she resents me and I can tell that she is just holding on long enough to set herself up with someplace to go when she leaves me.  We have had issues in the past but I have always been able to flip that switch, put on the brave face and do whatever it takes to work it out.  I have been trying but I feel spent and keep cracking up.  I almost broke down in a tears at my own birthday party in front of my kids, a simple dentist visit was too much and I almost started bawling while making a cup of coffee after. If I cant keep my shit together in normal situations how the hell do I do it for something big. 

My business life is a sham, I feel like I have been faking it for 20+ years now and at any moment someone is going to call me out on my bullshit.  It seems rock solid and everyone assumes that I am kicking ass but its always a razors edge balance.  I feel like family here, but I know how quick family can turn on you and shut you out. 

Its all become too damn much, I just want to be done with everything.  I already set everything up, I have had a plan in place to put an end to things while shielding my friends and family as much as possible.  It wont look like a suicide and no one would ever think that I did.  Just another tragic accident no different than all the others that happen every day. I took out a large life insurance policy, I established a trust for my children, I prepared documents with my attorney to handle my estate.  In the past simply having a plan in place was enough to keep me level and not do anything drastic, but the last month or so its been a real struggle every single day to not just do it.

I have spoken my my wife about feeling depressed and she wants me in therapy but thats another mountain to climb and I dont know if I have the energy to make it happen.  I had a therapist a few years ago and called her to set up an appointment last week but she refused to book me.  I dont recall how I ended therapy last time around but I must have said or done something horrible if she wont take me back.  That was a punch to the gut and I havent been able to make myself pick up the phone and call another one.  Quite frankly just the thought of sitting in a therapists office again makes me feel ill and uneasy.  I dont even know if it ever helped me or just made me better at faking it for everyone elses sake. 

TLDR: I am exhausted, tired, sad and just want to be done",suicide

5005,"Feeling like everyone would be much happier without me.I'm not sure I can keep feeling this way. Have you ever felt like if you disappeared or just died that no one would even notice. Not even the people you hold so dear to your heart. I've been screaming for help for a year and no one even cares. No matter what I'm wrong. For once I'd like to be acknowledged and respected. I just want to feel loved, I just want to feel anything other than despair and distrust. At this point in time I'd prefer to not exist at all than continue on fucking up everything and everyone else's lives, I'm only bringing them down. I wish I could take back all the hurtful things I've done to people, I wish I could rip out the parts of my brain that cause me anxiety and hold memories that I wish didn't exist at all. 

Most of all, I wish my wife loved me like I love her, I wish she had the same feelings for me that I do for her, I wish I could know for sure whether she's being faithful. I wish I knew how to trust her. If my marriage and family collapse, I'm as good as dead. I'm terrified that these past 6 years were for nothing. 

Just need someone to talk to. Someone to help me understand my mind or understand what I'm going through. ",suicide

5011,"I lost her...I lost her over a man because I couldn't adapt to the new situation fast enough. I was distant and silent around the guy so to pay me back he insulted me with my look and other qualities. I just dont want to talk about him or meet him, because he hurt me so bad, I just cannot. Long story short, now I'm the bad guy and she don't talk to me because I cannot listen to their stories. It's a fifty-fifty fault I think because I'm far from perfect but he went too far. I cannot open after those comments... 

I think I finally lost my friend who cannot stand by my side when I needed the most. I just wanna disappear because I'm a total failure. :(",suicide

5020,"I'm not doing so well, just thinking of how much time wasted dealing with my migraines, panic attacks, anxiety and wasting my wife's time.I'm not at a good place right now. I suffered a injury 2 years ago and feel like everything has been put on hold and now having a kid is out of range as we are in our late 30's. I've mistreated my wife by ignoring her needs and basically not doing any of my husband duties when it comes to affection (no sex drive for me and the medication makes it so i can't even finish. My wife deserves better than me.

&amp;#x200B;

She deserves to be happy and I know she is not wife how I've been MIA for the last 2 years and I feel like our conversations only involve my problems and never my wife's. I have been having extreme difficulty speaking to people over the phone. I start having shortness of breath and start basically stuttering to the point my wife has to speak to the person.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been kicked off of WorkSafe (workers compensation) for the last year and was told that my medical problems weren't work related even though I've never had a panic attack or migraines before my accident (fell at work) 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like if somehow we can get pregnant then I can just bow out and end it as I know I'm just a burden to my wife, so she can focus on being a mother, something shes always wanted.

5030,"Death and GuiltWe just lost a family friend to cancer, he's been sick and deteriorating for a while. Similarly to how my grandpa passed earlier this year, I watched him for weeks go from coherent to incoherent to barely there to the last hours. Watched the bottom of his feet turn purple slowly until his complexion turned yellow and his last breath a were inconsistent and shallow.  I couldn't not be there with him but it definitely traumatized me.  I tried to use that image and that experience to light my life torch but that was in March and I'm still really deep in this hole.  I really do feel like a prisoner to my own mind. And then today to hear our family friend went in a similar way. I just feel like a wasted life like a waste of space, why am I not having fun?  Life should be fun I think, I hope it gets more fun relatively soon.  I don't want to live like this for long, and I'm really trying hard to get better.  My eyes are so heavy and it's not even that often I can fake a smile anymore.  What's wrong with me, and I know you're all going to comment that there's nothing wrong with me, but there clearly has to be.  Something's wrong with my brain. And nobody cares or believes me, people think I create my own misery but I've had a lot of trauma and I think I've just lost a little of my natural resilience to life's unpredictable events.  I'm scared I will die alone, I don't want to.  Hope y'all are doing okay tonight.  Still breathing",suicide

5033,"Tonight I burned my letters and Im putting everything behind me.Let me start off by saying, this is a long ass story how I got here and I don‚Äôt care that much to say, especially since Im leaving that shit behind me. I told my girlfriend I was having bad thoughts about a month ago. We had just broken up but we really depend and need each other. It looks bad but the thoughts weren‚Äôt because of our break up, the break up didn‚Äôt help but it wasn‚Äôt about that. Well she kinda told me she would never forgive me if I did and I broke down crying(I never cry). She said it taking all of the pain you feel and giving it to everyone else thats ever cared about you. That last part wouldn‚Äôt bother me except that she‚Äôs the only exception I could never do that to her. Anyways, down the line I went on vacation for two weeks and we got into a couple phone call arguments eventually cutting all contact. I had told her that one night that Im going on vacation for two weeks and if something doesn‚Äôt change then Im making a decision.(Again not her its not the breakup). Well on vacation I decided I was going to do it. Nothing was changing and I was incapable of changing my situation. I was angry at God wondering why, begging for just a little peace or mind. Yesterday I came home from vacation. Last night I came to a huge realization that I know was planted in my brain by God. I woke up today a new person. Im strong enough to do this shit on my own. I‚Äôm ready to be a man now. I burned my letters. Called my girl because were on speaking terms again and I told her I burned them and that I feel like a brand new person and I feel like Im gonna be okay. She fucking lost it, she was so angry.  I‚Äôve never seen her so angry. She didn‚Äôt know about the notes. See I write her letters and eventually Ill hand them to her one day I have an entire stack. Well I forget some of the things I tell her in person and some of the things I write to her. She was not happy about it. I guess I was very insensitive though. Just expecting her to be like ‚ÄúThats great Im proud of you!‚Äù I hope she‚Äôs okay. I really do. Im tired of worrying her. I made it clear she doesn‚Äôt have to worry anymore. I hope we fix things I love that girl more than anything. Im so thankful I woke up better today. There‚Äôs a lot still going on and a lot still thats going to happen thats gonna make it hard, but I finally feel like Im strong enough to handle it. A couple weeks ago I had almost lost faith entirely. In God, in myself, in humanity. Now I know that there is just know way I can feel the way I do right now without God allowing me to feel this way. I don‚Äôt understand it, I thought God wanted me unhappy, I thought I was being punished. I didn‚Äôt know what to think and still don‚Äôt but Im done trying to understand it and Im putting this all behind me and moving on. Everything happens for a reason and I think this is all to make me into the man Im supposed to be. Im glad I can finally look back and say that.",suicide

The only thing stopping me is the fear that I'll fuck it up and end up on a vent as a quasi-vegetable.
I don't care how it will affect anybody left behind. I'll be gone and it won't matter.
Slowly, day by day, I'm losing the will to continue. I'm just tired of the day to day shit.  Tired of failing. Tired of being pissed off and pissed on.  If I could take a single pill right now and be 100 percent sure that it would end my life, I would do it.",suicide
